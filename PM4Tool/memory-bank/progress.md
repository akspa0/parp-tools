## WMO Group File Handling Progress (2024-06)

- WMO group file handling is now correct: group files are parsed individually and merged, not concatenated.
- This resolves previous mesh extraction failures due to invalid concatenation of root and group files.
- Loader and tooling now follow the canonical split-group pattern for WMO parsing and analysis.

**Status: WMO group file handling is now correct; further work needed for full fidelity, MSCN/MSLK research, and automation.**

## WMO Group File Parsing (3.3.5 WotLK) Progress (2024-06)

- Refactored `WmoGroupMesh.LoadFromStream` parser in `WoWToolbox.Core`.
- **What Works:**
    - Successfully parses the `MOGP` header.
    - Correctly attempts to read subsequent standard geometry chunks (`MOPY`, `MOVI`, `MOVT`, etc.) sequentially with standard headers, enforcing the strict order required by the format.
    - Gracefully handles group files that lack geometry chunks after `MOGP` (e.g., `ND_IronDwarf_LargeBuilding` groups) by detecting EOF and producing an empty mesh without errors.
    - Resolves previous parsing errors caused by incorrect offset reading or assumptions about sub-chunks within `MOGP`.
- **Tools Updated:**
    - `MSCNExplorer`'s `compare-root` command confirmed to use the updated `WmoGroupMesh.LoadFromStream` via the standard root->group loading pattern.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Test the parser with 3.3.5 group files known to *contain* geometry chunks after `MOGP` to verify that code path.
    - Integrate parser into other tools/workflows as needed.

**Status: 3.3.5 WMO group parsing logic in Core is implemented and handles files with missing trailing geometry chunks correctly. Further testing with geometry-containing files is recommended.**

## Core WMO API Finalization (2024-06)

- **Status:** Core APIs for handling WMO root and group files are finalized for current requirements.
- **Components:**
    - `WmoRootLoader.LoadGroupInfo`: Successfully reads group count from `MOHD` and actual group file names from `MOGN`.
    - `WmoGroupMesh.LoadFromStream`: Handles 3.3.5 group file structure (sequential chunks after `MOGP`) and correctly loads empty meshes for groups lacking geometry chunks.
    - `WmoGroupMesh.MergeMeshes`: Correctly merges geometry from multiple loaded groups.
- **Tooling Integration:**
    - `MSCNExplorer` updated to use `LoadGroupInfo` and implement flexible group file finding (tries internal MOGN name, falls back to numbered convention `*_XXX.wmo`). This allows loading test data where filenames don't match internal WMO names.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Document these Core APIs.
    - Integrate into other tools as needed. 

## PM4 vs. WMO Mesh Comparison (Updated 2024-07-21)

### What Works
-   **WMO Extraction:** Loading WMO root/groups, merging geometry, exporting merged mesh to OBJ (`ND_IronDwarf_LargeBuilding_merged.obj` generated successfully).
-   **PM4 Extraction:** Loading PM4 files, extracting *all* state-0 geometry (using MSUR/MDSF/MDOS links), exporting full state-0 mesh to OBJ (`extracted_pm4_mesh_unfiltered_dev0000.obj` generated successfully).
-   Build environment stable on .NET 9.0.

### What's Left to Build / In Progress
-   **PM4 Component Analysis:** Implement logic to analyze extracted PM4 `MeshData` to find connected components.
-   **PM4 Largest Component Extraction:** Implement logic to identify and extract the largest connected component from the PM4 `MeshData`.
-   **Comparison Logic:** Develop methods to compare the WMO `MeshData` against the largest PM4 component `MeshData`.
-   **Batch Processing Framework:** Design and implement a tool/script to automate the process across multiple PM4 files and their corresponding WMOs.

### Current Status
-   Successfully generated baseline OBJ files for a test WMO and the full state-0 geometry of its associated PM4 tile.
-   Pivoted away from flawed filename-based filtering within PM4 extraction.
-   Current strategy is to analyze connected components *after* extracting the full PM4 mesh. Ready to plan implementation of component analysis.

### Known Issues
-   ✅ **RESOLVED**: PM4 extraction previously skipped non-triangle faces - now handled with proper coordinate alignment
-   ✅ **RESOLVED**: Coordinate system mismatches between WMO and PM4 output - now using consistent PM4-relative system
-   The "largest component" hypothesis needs validation across more test cases.

## Mesh+MSCN Boundary Test Progress (2024-07-21)

### What Works
- New test for mesh extraction and MSCN boundary output successfully writes OBJ and diagnostics files for key PM4 files.
- All build errors related to type mismatches (`uint` vs `int`, `MsvtVertex` to `Vector3`) have been resolved.

### Current Issue
- The test process hangs after outputting the mesh and MSCN boundary files. The process does not exit and must be manually cancelled.
- All file streams appear to be closed, and no exceptions are reported, but the test method does not return.

### What's Left to Build / In Progress
- Debug and resolve the test process hang after mesh+MSCN boundary output.
- Once resolved, proceed with mesh comparison and placement inference.

### Known Issues
- Test automation is currently blocked by the process hang after mesh+MSCN boundary output.
- Further investigation is needed to ensure all resources are disposed and the test method completes as expected.

## Batch WMO-to-OBJ Exporter Progress (2025-04-18)

- Successfully implemented and validated a batch WMO-to-OBJ exporter as an xUnit test (`WmoBatchObjExportTests`).
- Recursively processes WMO binaries, exports each to OBJ, and writes to `/output/wmo/` with preserved folder structure.
- Uses caching: skips export if OBJ already exists, making repeated test runs efficient.
- This exporter is now the canonical workflow for generating OBJ caches for mesh comparison and analysis.
- Unblocks robust, repeatable PM4/WMO mesh analysis and placement inference workflows.

## WMO v14 Group Mesh Extraction Progress (2025-04-19)

### What Works
- v14-specific group chunk parser implemented: parses MOVT, MONR, MOTV, MOPY, MOVI, and assembles mesh data into mesh structures.
- OBJ export now works for v14 WMOs if all required subchunks are present and correctly parsed.
- Logging and error handling improved; missing geometry is now traceable to missing or malformed subchunks.

### What's Left to Build / In Progress
- Refine mesh assembly logic for edge cases and additional subchunks (MOBA, MLIQ, etc.).
- Add batch/group export support for multiple groups per WMO.
- Further improve error handling and debug output.
- Test and validate on a wider range of v14 WMOs.

### Known Issues
- Some geometry may still be missing due to incomplete chunk parsing or undocumented subchunk formats.
- Need for robust handling of optional/missing subchunks.
- Further research required for less common subchunks and edge cases.

## Completed Tasks (2024-07-21)
- Removed all liquid handling code and DBCD dependency from the project. Liquid support will be implemented in a separate project.

## New Focus: WMO Texturing Investigation (2024-07-21)
- Current focus is on robust handling of WMO chunk data for texturing, supporting both v14 (mirrormachine) and v17 (wow.export) formats.
- Next steps:
  - Review wow.export for v17 chunk/texturing support.
  - Crosswalk v14 (mirrormachine) knowledge to v17 structures.
  - Enumerate all relevant chunks and string fields.
  - Design a unified data model for texturing.
  - Update parsers and export logic accordingly.
- Goal: Enable full WMO/OBJ+MTL reconstruction with correct texturing for both legacy and modern formats.

## Progress Update (2024-07-21)
- v17 WMO writer skeleton is complete.
- Real serialization for MOMT (materials) and MOGI (group info) is implemented.
- WmoMaterial and WmoGroupInfo classes are mapped to the correct v17 binary layouts.
- Next steps: implement real serialization for MOHD (root header), MOBA (batch info), MOGP (group header), and integrate the writer into the v14→v17 conversion pipeline.
- Deep-dive analysis of chunk mapping and reference implementations is ongoing.
- Validation with wow.export, mirrormachine, and noggit-red is planned.

## Pending Implementation (2024-07-21)
- Unconditional export of MSCN points to all OBJ outputs (combined and per-file) is not yet implemented.
- The plan is to always include MSCN points with the (X, -Y, Z) transform and clear labeling, with no conditional flags.
- This will be retried in a new session.

## Progress Update: PM4 Test/Export Refactor v2

- **What works:** Existing test suite exports all mesh and chunk data, but with much duplicated logic and scattered coordinate conventions.
- **What's next:** Begin modularization:
  1. Implement `Pm4CoordinateTransforms` and migrate all coordinate logic.
  2. Refactor export logic into `ObjExportUtil`.
  3. Standardize validation with `ChunkValidator`.
  4. Update test flows and documentation.
- **Known issues:** High risk of errors when updating transforms or adding new chunk types due to code duplication.
- **Current status:** Refactor plan approved and mapped; implementation to begin.
