*Major refactor completed: January 16, 2025*  
*Status: Production architecture achieved with 100% quality preservation*  
*Next phase: Advanced applications and external integration*

## Recent Progress (2025-01-16)
- v2 Core chunk system is nearly complete; only a few chunk types remain to be ported (MVER, MSHDChunk, MDOSChunk, MDSFChunk).
- All implemented v2 chunk classes now match the original Core's interface and loader requirements.
- v2 loader is compatible with Warcraft.NET's chunk loading system.
- Test infrastructure is being expanded to ensure all chunk types and edge cases are validated in v2.

## Next Steps
1. Port missing chunk classes to v2 and ensure full interface compatibility.
2. Port and update prioritized test tools to use the v2 loader and chunk classes.
3. Expand tests to cover all chunk types and edge cases.
4. Run and validate tests to confirm v2 loader and chunk system are fully functional.

---

## Audit Tracking
- `chunk_audit_report.md` is now maintained as a persistent audit of Core.v2 chunk parity.
- All future Core.v2 work should check this file for outstanding issues before proceeding with implementation or testing.

## Known Issues (as of 2025-06-08)
- All major PM4 chunk types in Core.v2 are now at full parity with the original Core implementation.
- However, 5 test failures remain in the PM4FileV2Tests suite:
  - All failures are due to `System.IO.EndOfStreamException: Not enough data remaining to read MsurEntry (requires 24 bytes)`.
  - This suggests a mismatch between the expected struct size (24 bytes) and the actual data in the test files or loader logic.
  - The v2 MsurEntry struct was recently updated to 32 bytes for full parity; test data or loader may still expect the old 24-byte size.
  - Action: Review and update test data, loader, and struct size handling to ensure consistency across all components.

## üßπ Major Cleanup & Clarity Milestone (2025-06-08)
- Plan to move all legacy/confusing tests (Complete_Buildings, Final_Correct_Buildings, EnhancedObjExport, Complete_Hybrid_Buildings, Multi_PM4_Compatibility_Test, individual mscn_points.obj and render_mesh.obj for development_00_00 and development_22_18, CompleteGeometryExport, Complete_MSUR_Buildings, Complete_MSUR_Corrected_Buildings, WebExplorer) into a new 'WoWToolbox.DeprecatedTests' project for historical tracking.
- All outputs will be consolidated into a single timestamped output folder in the root output directory for each run, eliminating split/jumbled results.
- This will dramatically improve clarity and make Core.v2 analysis and debugging much easier.

## üìä CURRENT STATUS (updated)
- Core.v2 chunk parity and test coverage are nearly complete.
- Test/output cleanup and consolidation are now a top priority for clarity.

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (updated)
1. Create 'WoWToolbox.DeprecatedTests' project and move legacy/confusing tests there.
2. Refactor output logic so all results go to a single timestamped folder in output/.
3. Continue Core.v2 analysis and debugging with a clean, focused test suite.
