=== MSLK HIERARCHY ANALYSIS ===
File: development_14_35.pm4
Total Nodes: 1
Root Nodes: 1
Max Depth: 0
Geometry Nodes: 0
Doodad Nodes: 1

=== DISCOVERED PATTERNS ===
• PARENT INDEX ANALYSIS:
•   Self-references: 1 (100.0%)
•   Valid parent refs: 0 (0.0%)
•   Invalid refs: 0 (0.0%)
• HYPOTHESIS: ParentIndex_0x04 may represent GROUP MEMBERSHIP, not hierarchy
•   - Self-references likely indicate 'group leaders' or 'primary objects'
•   - This is NOT a traditional parent-child tree structure
• Node 0 self-references (primary object candidate)
• SUMMARY: 1 self-refs, 0 other refs
• Hierarchy levels found: 1
•   Depth 0: Flags [0x01]
• Geometry/Doodad distribution by depth:
•   Depth 0: 0 geometry, 1 doodad nodes
• INVESTIGATING ALTERNATIVE HIERARCHY INDICATORS:
•   Sequence field groups: 0
•   Cross-reference groups: 0
•   Unknown_0x0C groups: 0
• RECOMMENDATION: Use self-referencing nodes as primary objects for export

=== PARENT INDEX DISTRIBUTION ===
Top parent indices (potential hierarchy roots):
  Parent Index 0: 1 children

=== FLAG DISTRIBUTION ===
  Flag 0x01: 1 total (0 geom, 1 doodad)

=== SAMPLE HIERARCHY TREES ===
Root Node 0 (Flag: 0x01):
  DOOD_0 [Flag:0x01, Seq:1]
