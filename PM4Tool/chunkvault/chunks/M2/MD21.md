# MD21: M2 Data

## Identification
- **Chunk ID**: MD21
- **Parent Format**: M2
- **Source**: M2 file format documentation

## Description
The MD21 chunk contains the complete M2 data in the pre-Legion format. This chunk was introduced in Legion (expansion level 7) when the M2 format shifted to a chunked structure. The content is identical to a pre-Legion M2 file, starting with the MD20 magic. All offsets inside this chunk are relative to the chunk's start position, not the file's beginning.

## Structure
```cpp
struct MD21Chunk {
    M2Data pre_legion_style_data;  // Contains the entire pre-Legion M2 data
}
```

The `pre_legion_style_data` is a complete M2 structure that starts with the MD20 header and includes all the traditional M2 data (bones, animations, vertices, etc.).

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| pre_legion_style_data | M2Data | The complete M2 data from the pre-chunked format |

## Dependencies
- This chunk is the core container for all M2 data and is referenced by all other M2 chunks.
- The data inside follows the same structure as pre-Legion M2 files, starting with the MD20 header.

## Implementation Notes
1. When parsing, all offsets inside this chunk are relative to the chunk's start, not the file start.
2. If the file starts with "MD20" instead of using chunks, it should be loaded as a pre-Legion M2 file.
3. The chunk must be processed first before other chunks, as it contains the core model data.
4. Chunks can appear in any order in the file, with MD21 often being the first.

## Usage Context
This chunk stores the complete model data for a World of Warcraft model, including:
- Mesh geometry and vertex data
- Skeletal structure and bone hierarchy
- Animation data and sequences
- Material and texture information
- Particle and ribbon emitter definitions
- Light and camera setup

The MD21 chunk essentially wraps the pre-Legion M2 format to maintain backward compatibility while allowing for additional chunks to extend functionality.
