# M2 Model Format Documentation

## Overview
The M2 format is used to store 3D models in World of Warcraft, representing characters, creatures, doodads, and other game objects. Unlike most other WoW file formats, the M2 format was traditionally non-chunked (prior to Legion), with a header-based structure containing offsets to various data sections. Starting with Legion, M2 files use a chunked format starting with an MD21 chunk.

M2 files don't contain all the necessary data for rendering and animation. Additional files are used in conjunction with M2 files:
- **.skin**: Contains additional rendering information and optimizations
- **.anim**: Contains animation data
- **.bone**: Contains bone lookup data (added in Shadowlands)
- **.skel**: Contains skeleton information
- **.phys**: Contains physics data

## M2 Structure (Pre-Legion)
Prior to Legion, M2 files used a header-based structure with offsets pointing to data arrays. For a complete detailed structure, see [Pre-Legion Format](chunks/M2/PreLegionFormat.md).

### Header
The M2 header contains counts and offsets to various data arrays in the file.

## Relationships to Other Formats
M2 files interact with several other formats in the WoW client:
- **WMO**: M2 models can be placed inside WMO (World Map Object) files as doodads
- **ADT**: M2 models can be placed in the game world through ADT files
- **BLP**: Textures referenced by M2 files are stored in BLP format
- **DB2**: Various database files contain references to M2 models

## Key Concepts

### Animation System
M2 models use a complex animation system with:
- Multiple animation sequences (defined in M2Sequence structures)
- Bone-based skeletal animations (defined in M2CompBone structures)
- Key frame animation tracks (defined in M2AnimTrack structures)
- Key frame interpolation
- Global sequences for continuous animations
- Specialized animation control (through chunks like AFRA)

### Geometry System
M2 models define geometry through:
- Vertex data (defined in M2Vertex structures)
- Bone weights for skeletal animation
- Texture coordinates for material mapping
- Enhanced edge effects (through the EDGF chunk)

### Material System
Materials in M2 define visual appearance through:
- Multiple texture layers
- Blend modes
- Shader flags
- Animation properties
- Distance-based alpha attenuation (through the NERF chunk)

### Lighting System
M2 supports various lighting effects:
- Light sources with parameters
- Enhanced detail lighting (through the DETL chunk)
- Dynamic shadow rendering

### Particle Systems
M2 supports particle effects through:
- Particle emitters for smoke, fire, etc.
- Ribbon emitters for trails
- Various emitter shapes and behaviors

### Physics and Boundaries
- Dynamic bounding object control (through the DBOC chunk)
- Physics force data
- Geometry-based collision

## Next Steps
1. Document pre-Legion data structures
2. Create sample parsers for M2 data
3. Implement parsing for M2 chunks
4. Implement rendering for basic M2 models
5. Add animation support
6. Add support for supplementary files (.skin, .anim, etc.)

## Known Issues and Limitations
- Complex animation system with multiple dependencies
- Version differences in structure sizes and layouts
- Legacy data structures maintained for backward compatibility
- Chunked vs. non-chunked format differences
- Shadowlands additions (EDGF, NERF, DETL, DBOC, AFRA) may have incomplete documentation
