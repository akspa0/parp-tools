- **Master control**: Single root (0x00000000) manages entire hierarchy
- **Progressive subdivision**: 13 levels of geometric organization
- **Bit masking patterns**: Parent-child relationships follow binary patterns
- **Exclusive ranges**: Each group controls distinct vertex ranges

### Cross-Reference Network:
- **12,818 connections** via Unknown_0x10 field
- **Navigation system**: Cross-references enable movement between hierarchy branches
- **Hub identification**: Some nodes have >5 cross-references (highlighted)

### Spatial Organization:
- **Compact usage**: ~1% of PM4 coordinate space per dimension
- **Exclusive ownership**: No vertex overlap between groups
- **Efficient indexing**: Hierarchical access to geometry data
