# Product Context (Next)

- Why: Modernize and modularize the legacy tooling into a reusable .NET library and CLI, with clear APIs and robust data conversions (including liquids).
- Users: Internal developers converting WoW map assets across Alpha and LK eras.
- UX:
  - Library: documented public API, stable exceptions, predictable outputs identical to parity goals.
  - CLI: intuitive flags, clear logging, skip-if-missing fixtures support for tests.
- Constraints: Maintain LK behavior and output compatibility; focus on LK/Alpha scope (Cataclysm+ out of scope).
- Emphasis: Docs-first; memory bank reflects current plan and progress.
