# Project Brief (Next)

- Name: GillijimProject.Next
- Status: Refactor-in-progress with docs-first emphasis
- Current Goal: Implement robust MH2O↔MCLQ liquid conversion as part of the Next pipeline, with clean domain models, converters, CLI flags, tests, and docs.
- Scope: LK-only ADT/WDT pipeline (Cataclysm+ out of scope), Alpha reverse writer retained for back-compat scenarios.
- Philosophy: Parity-first where needed, then idiomatic C#; single source of truth in code with thorough inline XML docs; docs-first repository structure.
- Deliverables: Library (Next.Core) with public API, CLI (Next.Cli) wrapper, tests (Next.Tests), and up-to-date docs (next/docs).
