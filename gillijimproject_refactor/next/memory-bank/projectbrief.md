# Project Brief (Next)

- Name: GillijimProject.Next
- Status: Refactor-in-progress with docs-first emphasis
- Current Goal: Core parity: WDT Alpha→LK conversion and ADT LK roundtrip with Liquids integration; PM4 features deferred until core is shipped.
- Scope: LK-only ADT/WDT pipeline (Cataclysm+ out of scope), Alpha reverse writer retained for back-compat scenarios.
- Philosophy: Parity-first where needed, then idiomatic C#; single source of truth in code with thorough inline XML docs; docs-first repository structure.
- Deliverables: Library (Next.Core) with public API, CLI (Next.Cli) wrapper, tests (Next.Tests), and up-to-date docs (next/docs).
