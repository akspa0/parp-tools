# Project Brief

- Name: GillijimProject C# Port
- Goal: Port legacy C++ project (`lib/gillijimproject`) to a .NET 9 console app under `src/gillijimproject-csharp`.
- Scope (initial): Alpha WDT → ADT pipeline parity with original (`main.cpp`).
- Philosophy: Parity-first, then refine. Follow `.windsurf/rules/csharp-port.md`.
- Deliverable: Working CLI that reads Alpha WDT, converts to WDT + ADTs (Lich King), writes outputs.
