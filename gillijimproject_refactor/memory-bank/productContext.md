# Product Context

- Why: Modernize legacy tooling into a maintainable, reusable .NET library with a thin CLI, enabling safer and faster ADT writing.
- Users: Internal devs converting WoW map assets (Alpha → Lich King).
- UX:
  - Library: documented public API, stable semantic versioning, clear exceptions.
  - CLI: simple args, clear logging, stable outputs identical to parity phase.
- Constraints: Maintain LK behavior and output compatibility; LK-only scope (Cataclysm excluded) until integration is stable.
