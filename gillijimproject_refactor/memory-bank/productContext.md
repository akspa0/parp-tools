# Product Context

- Why: Modernize legacy tooling, enable maintainable .NET pipeline with tests and tooling.
- Users: Internal devs converting WoW map assets (Alpha → Lich King).
- UX: CLI-first; simple args; clear logging; stable file outputs.
- Constraints: Faithful 1:1 behavior to C++; LK-only (Cataclysm excluded) until LK parity is complete.
