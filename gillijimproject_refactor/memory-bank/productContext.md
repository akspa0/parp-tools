# Product Context

- Why: Modernize legacy tooling, enable maintainable .NET pipeline with tests and tooling.
- Users: Internal devs converting WoW map assets (Alpha → Lich King).
- UX: CLI-first; simple args; clear logging; stable file outputs.
- Constraints: Faithful behavior to C++ until validated; avoid premature refactors.
