# Active Context

- Current Focus: Port core primitives (Utilities, WowChunkedFormat, Chunk). Stub Program CLI.
- Recent Changes: Added Utilities.cs, WowChunkedFormat.cs, Chunk.cs; Program.cs stub (now prints WDT version); AdtAlpha skeleton; Mphd.cs; Wdt.cs; WdtAlpha skeleton.
- Next Steps: Implement full chunk parsing usage; port WdtAlpha parsing and Wdt writing; complete AdtAlpha parsing; wire main flow.
- Decisions: One C++ file → one C# file; `[PORT]` notes and XML docs; exceptions for errors.
