# Memory Bank Archive

This folder contains historical session logs and detailed progress documentation that have been moved out of the active memory bank to keep the main files concise.

## Archive Structure

### Monthly Session Files
- `2026-01-sessions.md` - Detailed session logs from January 2026
- `2026-01-progress.md` - Detailed progress notes from January 2026

## What Goes Here

- Detailed session logs with specific dates
- Step-by-step implementation details
- Debugging sessions and their resolutions
- Historical context that's no longer immediately relevant

## What Stays in Main Memory Bank

The main `memory-bank/` folder only contains:
- `projectbrief.md` - Static mission/scope
- `techContext.md` - Static tech stack/paths
- `systemPatterns.md` - Static FourCC/ADT rules
- `data-paths.md` - Static fixed paths
- `activeContext.md` - CURRENT FOCUS ONLY (~50 lines)
- `progress.md` - SUMMARY TABLE ONLY

## Archiving Process

When a session becomes historical:
1. Move detailed logs from `activeContext.md` to an archive file
2. Move detailed progress from `progress.md` to an archive file
3. Rewrite main files to be concise and forward-looking
4. Update archive with clear dates and context

This ensures the memory bank stays useful for daily work while preserving all historical context.
