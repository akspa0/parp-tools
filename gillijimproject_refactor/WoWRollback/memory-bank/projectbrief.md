# WoWRollback - Digital Archaeology of World of Warcraft Development

## Project Vision
WoWRollback is a digital archaeology tool that treats UniqueID ranges in World of Warcraft as **sedimentary layers of game development history**. Each range represents a "volume of work" performed by artists and developers over 20+ years, preserved as fossils in the game's data structures.

## Core Purpose
1. **Archaeological Analysis**: Extract and analyze UniqueID ranges from Alpha WDT files and converted LK ADT files to understand the evolution of WoW's content
2. **Historical Preservation**: Document singleton IDs and small gaps that represent technological enhancements, tests, or experiments left by the development team
3. **Rollback Functionality**: Enable selective removal of placement ranges during Alpha→LK conversion for "time-travel" map views

## Key Insights
- Each UniqueID range represents a discrete work session or content addition by the development team
- Singleton IDs and outliers are precious artifacts showing experiments, tests, or technological changes
- The data provides a chronological view of WoW's development from 2000 onwards
- Modern WoW still contains significant amounts of Alpha-era content, preserved in the UniqueID sedimentary layers

## Stakeholders
- **WoW Historians**: Researchers studying the game's evolution
- **Content Archaeologists**: People interested in uncovering lost or hidden content
- **Developers**: Those working with WoW file formats and conversion tools
- **Community**: Players interested in WoW's development history

## Success Criteria
- Extract complete UniqueID range data from both Alpha WDT and LK ADT files
- Identify and preserve singleton outliers as important historical artifacts
- Generate comprehensive before/after comparison showing content evolution
- Enable rollback functionality for creating historical map versions
- Document the archaeological significance of different UniqueID patterns
