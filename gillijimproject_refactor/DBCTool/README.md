## DBCTool
We just need a basic DBC handling tool for AreaID fixes. We're building it with StormLib in mind.

## Setup
Clone StormLib into the root lib folder, and compile all of it.

## Examples

I dunno, I'm in the middle of the MPQ functionality implementation so this isn't exactly figured out yet. Hopefully we don't need to type out multiple MPQ filenames...
