## BLOCKER: MDX Doodad Textures — Root Cause Unknown

MDX doodads render in correct positions but ALL textures are magenta. This has been the case since the beginning and multiple fix attempts have failed.

### What has been tried (and did NOT fix it):
1. **ResolveReplaceableTexture rewrite** — 4-strategy resolution (DBC, naming conventions, dir scan, hardcoded defaults). Did not help.
2. **Alpha test threshold change** — Lowered from 0.3 to 0.1, made conditional on uAlphaTest. Did not help.
3. **`.blp.MPQ` scan** — WRONG: `.blp.MPQ` files do not exist in WoW Alpha. This was fabricated. Reverted.

### What needs to happen next:
1. **Runtime diagnostic logging** — Print every texture path lookup and result during MDX loading
2. **Check MPQ file set** — How many BLP files exist? What are their paths?
3. **Trace one specific tree model** — Full path from TEXS chunk → resolution → ReadFile → result
4. **Do NOT guess at fixes** — Understand the problem first

## Detailed Fix Log

### 2026-02-09 Late Evening — Performance, Fog, Culling, Failed MDX Fix

**Completed (working):**
- Batched overlay rendering — POI pins + taxi paths in single draw call (BoundingBoxRenderer rewrite)
- AreaID/MapID-aware area name lookup — filters by current map, warns on mismatch
- Minimap zoom — 4 tiles around camera, scrollable
- TaxiPath visualization — DBC-loaded flight paths as 3D lines with selection
- POI + Taxi disabled by default
- NoCullRadius (150 units) — nearby objects skip frustum cull to prevent pop-in
- Fog added to MDX shader — models blend into fog like terrain
- Fog added to WMO shader — WMOs blend into fog like terrain
- Fog-based terrain chunk culling — skip chunks beyond FogEnd+200
- AOI radius reduced 3→2 (49→25 tiles)
- Doodad cull distance reduced 1500→1200, WMO cull distance 5000→2000
- README renamed to AlphaWoW Viewer

**Failed (reverted or ineffective):**
- `.blp.MPQ` scan — WRONG, these files don't exist. Reverted.
- ResolveReplaceableTexture 4-strategy rewrite — did not fix magenta textures
- Alpha test threshold change (0.3→0.1, conditional) — did not fix magenta textures

**Key files modified:**
- `BoundingBoxRenderer.cs` — Complete rewrite for batched rendering
- `WorldScene.cs` — Batched overlays, fog passing, reduced cull distances, NoCullRadius
- `TerrainManager.cs` — AOI radius 3→2
- `TerrainRenderer.cs` — Fog-based chunk distance culling
- `ModelRenderer.cs` — Fog shader, alpha test fix, ResolveReplaceableTexture rewrite
- `WmoRenderer.cs` — Fog shader
- `AreaTableService.cs` — MapID-aware lookup
- `ViewerApp.cs` — MapID tracking, area name display
- `MpqDataSource.cs` — Reverted bad .blp.MPQ change

### 2026-02-08 Evening — Shadow, Pivot, VLM Generator

**MCSH Shadow Blending Fix** (TerrainRenderer.cs):
- Shadow was only applied on base layer (`uIsBaseLayer == 1`). Overlay texture layers drawn on top with alpha blending would wash out shadows.
- Fix: Removed `isBaseLayer` guard from both C# shadow texture binding and GLSL shader shadow application.
- C#: `bool hasShadow = isBaseLayer && chunk.ShadowTexture != 0` → `bool hasShadow = chunk.ShadowTexture != 0`
- GLSL: `if (uShowShadowMap == 1 && uIsBaseLayer == 1 && uHasShadowMap == 1)` → `if (uShowShadowMap == 1 && uHasShadowMap == 1)`

**MDX Bounding Box Pivot Offset** (WorldScene.cs, WorldAssetManager.cs):
- MDX geometry is offset from origin. MODL bounding box center = effective pivot.
- Added `WorldAssetManager.TryGetMdxPivotOffset()` → `(BoundsMin + BoundsMax) * 0.5f`
- Transform chain: `pivotCorrection * mirrorX * scale * rotX * rotY * rotZ * translation`
- `pivotCorrection = Matrix4x4.CreateTranslation(-pivot)`
- Applied in both `BuildInstances()` and `OnTileLoaded()`.
- WMO models do NOT need pivot correction.
- Note: PIVT chunk is for per-bone skeletal pivots, NOT placement pivot.

**VLM Dataset Generator** (ViewerApp.cs):
- Menu: `File > Generate VLM Dataset...`
- Uses `VlmDatasetExporter.ExportMapAsync()` from WoWMapConverter.Core on ThreadPool.
- Progress log via `IProgress<string>`, "Open in Viewer" button on completion.

### 2026-02-08 Afternoon — VLM Terrain, Async Streaming, Thread Safety

**VLM Terrain Rendering Fixes** (VlmProjectLoader.cs, TerrainRenderer.cs):
- GLSL shader em-dash → ASCII hyphen (compilation error).
- NullReferenceException in DrawTerrainControls → null-conditional access.
- VLM coordinate conversion: swapped posX/posY, removed MapOrigin subtraction.

**Minimap for VLM** (ViewerApp.cs, VlmTerrainManager.cs):
- `DrawMinimap()` refactored to support both `_terrainManager` and `_vlmTerrainManager`.
- Added `IsTileLoaded()` to VlmTerrainManager.

**Async Tile Streaming** (TerrainManager.cs, VlmTerrainManager.cs):
- `UpdateAOI()` queues tiles to ThreadPool for background JSON/ADT parsing.
- `ConcurrentQueue<TileLoadResult>` for render-thread submission.
- `SubmitPendingTiles()` uploads max 2 tiles/frame.
- `_disposed` flag prevents post-dispose background access.

**Thread Safety** (VlmProjectLoader.cs, AlphaTerrainAdapter.cs, TerrainRenderer.cs):
- `TileTextures` → `ConcurrentDictionary` in both adapters.
- `_placementLock` protects `_seenMddfIds`, `_seenModfIds`, placement lists.
- `CollectMddfPlacements()` and `CollectModfPlacements()` also locked.
- `TerrainRenderer.AddChunks()` parameter: `Dictionary` → `IDictionary`.

### 2026-02-08 Morning — MDX, BIDX, MTLS, GLB

- Fixed standalone MDX rendering — MirrorX model matrix for LH→RH conversion
- Fixed BIDX parsing — 1 byte per vertex (not 4)
- Reverted MTLS dual-format heuristic — back to stable count-header format
- Fixed WMO WorldScene regression — reverted to stable commit a1b0b41
- Fixed GLB export — Z-up → Y-up conversion for MDX and WMO
- Added terrain alpha mask debug view (Show Alpha Masks toggle)
- Applied Noggit edge fix for terrain alpha map seams

### 2026-02-07 — World Scene, Minimap, AreaPOI

- Phase 4 — World Scene: lazy tile loading, MDDF/MODF placements, object rendering
- Fixed MDX holes — disabled backface culling
- Fixed WMO textures — BLP loaded per-batch from materials
- Fixed MODF bounding boxes — actual extents with min/max swap
- Added live minimap with click-to-teleport
- Added AreaPOI system (DBC loading, 3D/minimap markers, UI list)
- Fixed MDX blend modes — depth mask off for transparent layers, alpha discard 0.1
- WMO doodads now rendered with WMO's modelMatrix

### 2026-02-06 — Foundation + Terrain

- Phase 0 COMPLETE — 6 foundation files
- Phase 3 COMPLETE — 7 terrain files + ViewerApp integration
