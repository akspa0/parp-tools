Break complex problems and solutions down into smaller pieces, especially when preparing edits to files. If a problem seems too complex, break it down into smaller steps to solve the problem. If the user provides too complex a problem to solve simply, build planning documentation in markdown format and save them in a docs\planning\ folder in the root of the project, to be worked on, step by step. Number the plans in sequential order so we can move through the steps and complete large problems over the span of multiple chat sessions.
