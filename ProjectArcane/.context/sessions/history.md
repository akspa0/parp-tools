2. Begin implementation of the M2 parser based on the documentation
3. Create rendering system for M2 models
4. Implement animation system support
5. Add support for supplementary files (.skin, .anim, etc.) 

## Session 2025-04-12: M2 Core Structure Documentation

In this session, we've documented key M2 core structures that are essential for the pre-Legion format and used within the chunked format:

1. Documented the following structures:
   - M2Sequence - Definition of animation sequences including timing, blending, and playback properties
   - M2AnimTrack - Animation keyframe tracks for various properties (positions, rotations, colors, etc.)
   - M2Vertex - Vertex definition including position, normal, texture coordinates, and bone weights

2. Expanded documentation to include both chunked and non-chunked M2 formats:
   - Now covering both the Legion+ chunked format (22/22 chunks, 100%)
   - And the pre-Legion header-based structures (3/24 structures, 12.5%)
   - Combined completion: 25/46 total components (54.3%)

3. Updated all index files to reflect the new documentation:
   - Updated M2_index.md to show structure documentation progress
   - Updated chunkvault/index.md to include structure counts alongside chunk counts
   - Modified implementation status to reflect combined progress

The structures documented so far form the foundation of the M2 animation and geometry systems:
- M2Sequence defines the animations available to the model (walk, run, cast, etc.)
- M2AnimTrack defines how individual properties animate over time using keyframes
- M2Vertex defines the 3D geometry and how it's influenced by bones during animation
- Together they enable both the complex animation system and the base geometry that brings models to life

These structures are crucial regardless of whether the M2 file uses the newer chunked format or the classic header-based format. They represent the core architecture that has remained consistent throughout WoW's development.

Next steps:
1. Continue documenting remaining pre-Legion structures
2. Focus on M2 texture and material structures next
3. Complete documentation of all M2 core structures
4. Begin implementation planning based on complete documentation 

## Session 2025-04-13: M2 Shadowlands Chunks Documentation

1. Documented the following chunks added in Shadowlands:
   - EDGF (Edge Fade) - Edge fading effects for specific mesh types
   - NERF (Alpha Attenuation) - Distance-based alpha attenuation system
   - DETL (Detail Lighting) - Enhanced parameters for light sources
   - DBOC (Dynamic Bounding Object Control) - Parameters for dynamic object boundaries
   - AFRA (Alpha Frame) - Frame-exact control for alpha animations

2. Expanded M2 documentation coverage:
   - Previously: 22 chunks and 3 structures documented
   - Now: 27 chunks and 3 structures documented
   - Total progress: 30/51 components (58.8%)

3. Updated all index files to reflect the additional documentation:
   - Updated M2_index.md with the newly documented Shadowlands chunks
   - Enhanced content with additional sections on Lighting System and Physics and Boundaries
   - Updated chunkvault/index.md to show 27/27 chunks (100%) for M2
   - Adjusted implementation status to reflect combined progress

The newly documented chunks represent specialized rendering enhancements introduced in Shadowlands (9.0.1):
- EDGF provides edge fading effects that improve visual quality for specific mesh types
- NERF implements a sophisticated alpha attenuation system based on view distance
- DETL enhances light sources with additional parameters for shadows and diffuse color
- DBOC controls dynamic bounding volumes for objects with changing boundaries
- AFRA enables precise alpha animation control at specific frames

These chunks demonstrate Blizzard's continued refinement of the M2 format to support enhanced visual effects and rendering techniques in modern expansions.
