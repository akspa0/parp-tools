## Initial Questions
1. Which file format should we implement first?
2. Do we need additional mathematical operations in our core types?
3. Should we add validation for chunk relationships?
4. Do we need to implement caching for shared resources?
5. Should we add support for writing validated paths back to files?
6. Do we need additional pattern matching for specific asset types?
7. How should we handle version-specific features in WMO and M2 formats?
8. Should we implement a unified animation system across formats?
9. How should we handle MDX-specific features not present in M2 format?
10. Do we need specialized texture handling for MDX team colors?

## Closing Questions
1. Are all file format handlers properly tested?
2. Have we documented format-specific quirks and edge cases?
3. Is error handling comprehensive across all parsers?
4. Do we need additional reporting or debugging features?
5. Should we implement batch validation for multiple files?
6. Do we need to optimize the path validation system for large files?
7. Are version-specific features properly isolated?
8. Do we need migration tools between format versions?

  - Doodad chunks (MODS, MODN, MODD)

- Implemented group chunk conversion:
  - MOGP with v14 flags
  - Geometry chunks (MOPY, MOVI, MOVT, MONR, MOTV)
  - BSP tree chunks (MOBN, MOBR) for collision
  - Batch conversion (MOBA ‚Üí v14 format)

## Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Collision validation
- ‚úÖ Root chunk conversion
- ‚úÖ Group chunk conversion
- ‚úÖ Flag mappings
- ‚úÖ Lighting conversion
