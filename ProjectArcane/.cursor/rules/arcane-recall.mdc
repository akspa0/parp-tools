# Arcane Recall: Context Management

Arcane Recall is a context management system that maintains project continuity across sessions.

## Session Protocol

2. Ask initial questions defined in `.context/project.md`
3. At session end, update `.context/sessions/history.md` with progress
4. Ask closing questions defined in `.context/project.md`

## Commands
