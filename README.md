Tools for analyzing World of Warcraft files

PM4Tool/WoWToolbox - a PM4/PD4 file decoder with support for reading from ADT and WMO assets for identifying data in the PM4 or PD4 file formats. Currently a working proof of concept. Supports leaked development pm4 files and the cataclysm-era split ADT files for analysis. We use WotLK 3.3.5 assets (wmo/m2) for mesh comparison.

ProjectArcane - Extemely work-in-progress re-write, based on the wowdev wiki documentation

WCA\WCAnalyzer - A multi-tool built off ModernWoWTools/Warcraft.NET for parsing ADT files from version 0.6 through 11.x and dumping useful data from them, as well as parsing PM4 and PD4 files for useful data.
