# Active Context — wow-viewer

Last updated: 2026-08-14

This file is the interchange for the next agent. It records only the current routing state. Read
the owning spec for requirements and proof; read a workstream only when the spec links it.

## Current handoff

- **Next implementation target:** User-run Alpha 0.5.3 audio proof with the corrected MCSE/MCNK
  positions: inspect a water or environmental trigger near the camera, confirm the diagnostic world
  coordinate follows the visible chunk, then enable one row and verify audible range behavior. Keep
  unresolved SoundWaterType rows and default-off trigger controls explicit.
- **Performance planning target:** Spec 150 remains the broad Alpha 0.5.3 renderer evidence lane. Spec
  151 owns the first concrete portal-specific optimization; use its counters and fallback evidence to
  inform later repeated `profile-render` baselines. Do not infer a win from an interactive screenshot.
- **Proof owner:** Focused PM4/audio contract tests and cross-platform viewer build pass; the user owns
  real-client region-camera, streaming, archive-provenance, and audible proof. The current camera
  slice updates active tiles on mouse-look without reopening the residency lease.
- **Time-of-day checkpoint:** The interactive lighting path has a pure 2,880-unit/24-minute Alpha
  clock enabled by default, with manual slider freeze/resume; Light DBC and LIT consume the same frame
  time, while synthetic minimap manifests record a frozen time-of-day mode.
- **Completed slice:** Checkpoint commits `3bfbbba4` (accumulated audio, AreaNumber, Ghidra, and
  Zone/SubZone overlay work), `de41b183` (Spec Kit design pack), and `c70e1945` (portal phase)
  contain the work completed on this lane. Spec 151 Phase 1 now has a pure, fail-open WMO portal
  decision using transformed portal polygons/clip volumes, source-side admission, bounded
  depth/visit limits, renderer integration, and portal counters in `WmoRenderStats`; the old
  center-distance/queue traversal scaffolding is removed. Focused portal/graph tests pass 16/16 and
  the full solution Debug build passes with 0 errors. The graph evaluator is explicitly diagnostic;
  the shared runtime decision owns final renderer admission. Spec 149 now has an opt-in resident
  Zone/SubZone overlay slice: Ghidra-backed
  MCNK AreaNumber evidence, revisioned resident chunk enumeration, AreaTable-grouped footprint regions,
  distinct Zone/Subzone styling, projected labels, and unresolved-count diagnostics. Spec 148 now has a
  provenance-first world-simulator spec/plan/tasks pack;
  MCSE emitters preserve raw/transformed positions and the proven Alpha 0.5.3 0x34-byte scheduler
  fields; shared Alpha AreaNumber resolution splits high/low `ushort` zone/subzone words and follows
  `ParentAreaNum` without half-word aliases; the area contract now branches explicitly so 3.3.5+
  direct AreaTable IDs cannot be captured by Alpha AreaNumber aliases; status-bar and terrain audio now
  consume the same resolved Zone/SubZone result; the runtime exposes non-playing diagnostic rows; the audio panel
  shows IDs, coordinates, path/source, decode/backend state, terminal reason, and coordinate provenance.
- **Main unproven gap:** The time-of-day slice still needs live early-client visual proof and a
  comparison of authored minimap tint behavior; the theory that shipped minimaps captured a moving
  clock remains unproven. Spec 104's restored MDX material shader inputs still need real model/shader
  compilation and visual proof. Full BLS bytecode parity remains out of scope. Spec 151's game-mode head anchor/physics, simple-surface policy, and
  diagnostic budget remain unimplemented. Portal admission is source-tested but still needs the
  user-owned real-client visual/submission/FPS comparison. Spec 149's PM4 region
  bounds/focus, correlation UI retirement, focused area aggregation tests and default-off per-trigger
  audio controls remain open. MCSE tile/chunk
  normalization and MCNK liquid-center placement now have focused source/test proof, pending live
  runtime/audible proof. The area overlay is resident chunk coverage, not a
  proven complete polygon. ZoneMusic table indirection, exact `sounds.mpq` provenance, MIDI/DLS
  playback, and native MCSE callback installation remain separate proof gates. Spec 150 still lacks
  native renderer anchors, repeatable 0.5.3 baseline capture, and CPU/GPU attribution.
- **Explicitly out of scope for the next slice:** Simple-surface UI, logging-policy retirement,
  whole renderer rewrite, `.bls` bytecode loading/porting, fake audio conversion, and claims of
  visual/FPS/audible gains. Game-mode input/UI follows the pure Phase 2 runtime-core checkpoint.

## Active spec lanes

| Spec | State | Next handoff |
|---|---|---|
| 151 Portal-aware rendering/game mode/simple surface | Phase 1 portal checkpoint implemented; Phase 2 open | Add pure game-mode state/physics and character-head anchor; preserve editor camera state and stop at the focused physics checkpoint. |
| 104 Legacy M2/MDX rendering | 1.0.0 route complete; MDX material/effect shader checkpoint implemented with visual proof open | Validate shader compilation and translucent/reflective models against the configured client/build; keep full BLS parity separate. |
| 149 PM4 region navigation/audio trigger controls | Draft pack; resident area overlay, MCNK liquid producer, and coordinate normalization slices implemented | Add area aggregation/audio-control tests, then complete per-trigger toggles and ZoneMusic indirection; retire correlation UI only after the region checkpoint; keep world triggers default-off. |
| 150 Alpha 0.5.3 renderer performance | Draft evidence/planning pack complete; no source optimization started | Recover native world/terrain/object/resource/LOD anchors and run two repeated production `profile-render` baselines before choosing one owner. |
| 148 Artifact world simulator runtime | Phase 1 diagnostics in progress; client contract correction landed | Add ZoneMusic indirection, then finish read/decode/source-stage coverage and user real-client inspection. |
| 147 Minimap/fog/doodad instancing | Phase 2 implemented; Phase 3/4 open | User-run minimap proof, then implement fog coverage and structured batching diagnostics. |
| 146 Audio/camera playback | AreaNumber-aware area selection and master mute control implemented; client audio contracts recovered | Add ZoneMusic row resolution; MIDI/DLS and native MCSE callback proof remain gated. |
| 144 Camera capture paths | Implemented with user gates | Validate swept path residency during playback and confirm lease release before extensions. |
| 145 WoW UI overhaul | First slice implemented | Continue only the remaining persistent-window/placeholder audit tasks. |
| 143 World context and lighting | LIT source/fallback, pre-alpha v2 parser, and default-on 0.5.3 time cycle implemented with user gate | Validate live clock/manual freeze and authored-minimap tint boundaries, then continue WMO area and lighting evidence. |
| 142 World scene graph | In progress | User-run dense-WMO capture to compare internal-doodad batching against the prior placement-local path. |
| 139–141 Terrain/minimap reconstruction | Active/parked ML lanes | Reopen only for the named spec and user-run training/validation. |
| 138 Cross-era renderer research | Evidence/planning | Do not generalize one client build to every era. |
| 128–131 PM4 | Established research lane | Use the PM4 spec pack and `workstream-pm4-decode.md`. |

## Stable boundaries

- New code, tests, tools, and viewer docs go in `wow-viewer/`; the legacy tree is read-only
  reference unless a bounded compatibility fix is explicitly requested.
- Keep format readers library-first and tools thin. Do not duplicate or rewrite working client-file
  readers. Keep the Alpha/standard terrain split. `AlphaWdtWriter.cs` is frozen unless explicitly
  reopened with focused proof.
- Client roots are runtime configuration. `H:\CLIENTS` is approved; never hardcode a local client
  path. Record root, build identity, and fingerprint for client-backed proof.
- Training, GPU work, broad harvests, long captures, and real-client/runtime testing are user-run.
- The default source proof is:
  `dotnet build I:/parp/parp-tools/wow-viewer/WowViewer.slnx -c Debug`
  and
  `dotnet test I:/parp/parp-tools/wow-viewer/WowViewer.slnx -c Debug`.

## Continuity rules

- Update this dashboard and `progress.md` only when the implementation handoff changes.
- Put durable technical findings in the owning workstream or architecture note, not here.
- Preserve negative results and open gates, but remove superseded narrative from the default path.
- End every handoff with: current target, proof owner, completed slice, unproven gap, next bounded
  action, and explicit out-of-scope items.
