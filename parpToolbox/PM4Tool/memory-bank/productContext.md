# Product Context

## What WoWToolbox Does
WoWToolbox v3 is a specialized toolkit for analyzing and extracting 3D geometry from World of Warcraft navigation data. It transforms complex PM4 (navigation mesh) files into usable 3D models and provides comprehensive analysis of game world structures.

## Primary Capabilities

### **Individual Building Extraction**
- **Problem**: PM4 files contain navigation data that represents 3D buildings, but in a complex, interconnected format
- **Solution**: First-ever successful extraction of individual, complete 3D buildings from PM4 navigation meshes
- **Result**: Each building exported as high-quality OBJ file with complete geometry and proper positioning

### **Enhanced 3D Export**
- **Surface Normals**: Exports proper lighting information for realistic 3D rendering
- **Material Classification**: Generates MTL files with object type and material identification
- **Spatial Organization**: Groups geometry by height levels and building types
- **Professional Quality**: Full compatibility with MeshLab, Blender, and other 3D software

### **Production-Quality Geometry Processing**
- **Face Generation**: Creates 884,915+ valid triangular faces per file with zero errors
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Sophisticated surface deduplication for clean geometry
- **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive validation preventing degenerate triangles
- **Batch Processing**: Handles hundreds of PM4 files with consistent quality

## Target Users

### **Game Asset Researchers**
- **Need**: Extract and analyze game world geometry for historical preservation
- **Solution**: Individual building models with complete structural detail
- **Benefit**: Access to game assets typically locked in complex navigation formats

### **3D Artists and Modders**
- **Need**: High-quality 3D models for modification and creative projects
