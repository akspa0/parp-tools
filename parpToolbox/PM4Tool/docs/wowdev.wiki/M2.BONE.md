{{Template:SectionBox/VersionRange|min_expansionlevel=6}}
.bone files are [[Chunk|chunked]] with an extra header. They are named "%s_%02d.bone" % (base_name, variant) for models with sequence 808 present, one file per variant of that sequence.

=Header=
 uint32_t unk; // ignored, shall be 1 (possibly version?)

=BIDA=
 uint16_t bone_id[]; // count should be equivalent to number of FacePose (808) sequences - 1

=BOMT=
 {{Template:Type|C44Matrix}} boneOffsetMatrices[]; // same count as BIDA, transformation matrix for the given bone
