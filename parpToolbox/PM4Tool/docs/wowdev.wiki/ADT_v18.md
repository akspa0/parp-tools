[[ADT]] files contain terrain and object information for map tiles. They have a [[Chunk|chunked]] structure just like the [[WDT]] files.

A map tile is split up into 16x16 = 256 map chunks. (not the same as file chunks, although each map chunk will have its own file chunk :) ) So there will be a few initial data chunks to specify textures, objects, models, etc. followed by 256 [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] (mapchunk) chunks :) Each [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] chunk has a small header of its own, and additional chunks within its data block, following the same id-size-data format.

== Terminology Reference ==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Term !! Explanation
|-
| MapChunk (Chunk) || Refers to a chunk (terrain cell) represented by [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] data chunk.
|-
| MapTile (Tile) || Referes to one .ADT file (<{{Template:Sandbox/PrettyVersion|expansionlevel=4}}) or a group of ADT-related files representing one MapTile in [[WDT]].
|-
| Sub-chunk (used in some software) || Commonly used term to describe an area in [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]]'s heightmap. See MCNK holes for understanding. It is an abstraction, and is not represented by any data structure.
|}

== An important note about the coordinate system used ==
Wow's main coordinate system is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule#Coordinates right-handed]; understanding it is very important in order to correctly interpret the ADT files.

It's important to remember that:
* The positive X-axis points north, the positive Y-axis points west. 
* The Z-axis is vertical height, with 0 being sea level. 
* The origin of the coordinate system is in the center of the map.
* The top-left corner of the map has X = 17066, Y = 17066
* The bottom-right corner of the map has X = -17066, Y = -17066
* The bottom-left corner of the map has X = -17006, Y = 17066
* The top-right corner of the map has X = 17006, Y = -17066

Just to be absolutely clear, assuming you playing a character that is not flying or swimming and is facing north:
* Forward = Vector3(1, 0, 0)
* Right = Vector3(0, -1, 0)
* Up = Vector3(0, 0, 1);

This is the coordinate system used internally in all of the network packets and on most chunks in ADT files. Here is an overview of the other used [[#Coordinate_System_Translation|coordinate systems]].

== Map size, blocks, chunks ==
=== Introduction ===
All maps are divided into 64x64 '''blocks''' for a total of 4096 (some of which may be unused). Each block are divided into 16x16 '''chunks''' (not to be confused with for example the file chunks, such as the "MHDR" chunk.. Completely different thing!). While like I said blocks can be unused, each block will always use all of its 16x16 chunks. 

=== Map size ===
Each block is 533.33333 yards (1600 feet) in width and height. The map is divided into 64x64 blocks so the total width and height of the map will be 34133.33312 yards, however the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the map so the minimum and maximum X and Y coordinates will be Â±17066.66656).

Since each block has 16x16 chunks, the size of a chunk will be 33.3333 yards (100 feet).

=== Player's speed ===
Basic running speed of a player (without any speed modifying effects) is 7.1111 yards/s (21.3333 feet/s). Player is able to reach one border of an ADT tile from another in 75 seconds. Thus, the fastest mounts (310%) can get over ADT size in 24.2 seconds.

=== ADT files and blocks ===
There is an .adt file for each existing block. If a block is unused it won't have an .adt file. The file will be: '''World/Maps/<InternalMapName>/<InternalMapName>_<BlockX>_<BlockY>.adt'''.

* '''<InternalMapName>''' - {{Template:DBField|table=Map|column=m_Directory}}
* '''<BlockX>''' - Index of the tile on the X axis
* '''<BlockY>''' - Index of the tile on the Y axis

Converting ADT co-ords to block X/Y can be done with the following formula (where axis is x or y): floor((32 - (axis / 533.33333)))

=== Height ===

The previous section details on X and Y limits only. The Z (height) limit is only implicit by stuff breaking slowly, like [[#MFBO_chunk_.28BC.2B.29|MFBO]] which is limited by using signed shorts, i.e. 2^15 being their max height. [[WDL/v18]], while not mendatory, is probably the most important, it is also limited to 2^15 (-32k/+32k). There are some database files like [[DB/ZoneLight]] or world map related ones that also take height into account and may not be using floats depending on game version. [[DB/ZoneLight]] appears to be using -64000 and 64000 as the default if designers didn't put anything. [[DB/DungeonMapChunk]] seems to use -10000 for lower default. [[DB/UIMapAssignment]] wins with defaulting to -1000000 and 1000000. Generally, stay in the -32k/+32k range.

==split files (Cata+)==
{{Template:SectionBox/VersionRange|min_expansionlevel=4}}
Beginning with Cataclysm, ADTs are split into multiple files: .adt (root), _tex%d.adt (tex) and _obj%d.adt (obj) with %d being the level of detail (0 or 1). Chunks are distributed over the files. To load a map, the client loads a set of three and treats them as one. While the [[Media:Mjo_adt.png|distribution schema]] appears to be quite fixed, the client does not keep the semantics of which file is which and parses them all the same.

Note that _tex1.adt files are now longer loaded since the introduction of [[WDT|WDT]]'s [[WDT#MAID_chunk| MAID]]. The _obj1.adt continue to be used.

The main difference content-wise is [[ADT#MCIN_chunk_.28.3CCata.29|MCIN]] being gone, and [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] in tex and obj files not having the header it has in root files.

{{Template:Sandbox/PrettyVersion|expansionlevel=7}} added _lod.adt (lod) files as another type. They are used for increased draw distance, this time including low quality versions of liquids and geometry as well (in the end, root lod bands).

I've written a short guide on how to implement _lod.adt  [[ADTLodImplementation]] [[User:Zee|Zee]]

''How do I read this table?''
: Every 3D renderer, be it a modelling software, a game engine, or a 3D rendering framework, defines its own axes and orientation. This was done back in the days, when companies wanted to be as incompatible to another as possible. Invert an axis, swap two axes and importing/exporting without pre- and post processing will become impossible. Or require expensive conversion tools. History. In general, there are 2 systems with either Y-up, or Z-up and both can be either left-, or right-handed. Blizzard uses a Z-up, left handed coordinate system with swapped x- and y-axis. This coordinate system is also used by the WDT/ADT terrain system. But more importantly, it is the coordinate system between the world servers and the clients to position players, NPCs, all game objects in the world. A 3D vector with the 3 components x, y, and z is positioned inside the game as follows: The x-coordinate lies on the north-south axis with values increasing going to the north. North hereby is the actual north orientation inside the game. Similarly, the y-coordinate lies on the west-east axis with values increasing going to the west. The z-coordinate defines the height above the ground level. Blizzard also uses a yard-based system, 1 unit represents 1 yard. 

: Based on that orientation, the table gives a transformation into other renderers, while keeping directions intact. The north-south axis defines a forward/backward direction. The west-east axis defines a left/right direction. It is defined by the renderer if these axes are labelled x, y, z and if any are negated (going north to south, or going south to north). The table shows, what each renderer defines as its x-, y- and z-axis. Select the correct unit vectors, take the vector expression, and as a result you get the transformed vector that has the correct orientation inside the renderer. That means, for example in Unity or Blender, all models will be correctly positioned to the diverse left-view, right-view, top-view and all the other views.

* How to compute a matrix to map WMO to world coordinates
The position field in MODF is in Y-up coordinate system with upper-left corner being (0,0). And when you move to the right or down in this system the values increases.<br>
While in WoW world coordinates are in Z-up order with the top-left corner being (17.066, 17,066) and when you move to left or down - the values decreases.<br>
So to get a proper positioning you need to translate those values to world coordinate system by substracting them x and z (index 0 and 2 in position array) from 17,066.

The rotation field is given in degrees. You would need to translate it into radians before passing to rotate function.

Example implementation in js with gl-matrix library[https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix]:
 function createPlacementMatrix(modf){
     var TILESIZE = 533.333333333;
    
     var posx = 32*TILESIZE - modf.position[0];
     var posy = modf.position[1];
     var posz = 32*TILESIZE - modf.position[2];
    
    
     var placementMatrix = mat4.create();
     mat4.identity(placementMatrix);
    
     //Rotate coordinate system into Z-up
     mat4.rotateX(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, glMatrix.toRadian(90));
     mat4.rotateY(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, glMatrix.toRadian(90));
    
     //Translate the center of coordinate system
     mat4.translate(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, [posx, posy, posz]);
    
     // Rotate the coordinates
     mat4.rotateY(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, glMatrix.toRadian(modf.rotation[1]-270));
     mat4.rotateZ(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, glMatrix.toRadian(-modf.rotation[0]));
     mat4.rotateX(placementMatrix, placementMatrix, glMatrix.toRadian(modf.rotation[2]-90));
     
     return placementMatrix;
 }

To get WMO vertexes into world position, you would need to multiply this matrix by 4-component vertex vector from left, with index 0-2 being x, y, z and index 3 being 1.

 placementMatrix * (x, y, z, 1)

Example multiplication in js with gl-matrix:

 function translate (position, positionMatrix) {
   var position4 = vec4.fromValues(position[0], position[1], position[2], 1);
   vec4.transformMat4(position4 , position4 , positionMatrix);
   return position4;
 }

For rendering, it is recommended to make this transformation in shader. So you would not have dublicate vertex data in gpu memory. 
Example in glsl:
 attribute vec3 aPosition;
 uniform mat4 uPlacementMat;
 
 void main() {
     vec4 worldPoint = uPlacementMat * vec4(aPosition, 1);
     gl_Position = worldPoint;    
 }

== MH2O chunk (WotLK+) ==
{{Template:SectionBox/VersionRange|min_expansionlevel=3|note=Replacement for [[#MCLQ_sub-chunk|MCLQ]]}}
* split files: root
Replacement for [[#MCLQ_sub-chunk|MCLQ]], which is still parsed by the client for backwards compatibility.

The chunk is seperated in three parts: A header (<tt>SMLiquidChunk</tt>), the data-block (<tt>SMLiquidInstance</tt>) and the referenced data from both. Reading it all at once and then using the supplied offsets inside is recommended. All offsets are relative to the data begin of the chunk. The header is the only part with a guaranteed position. All other parts are specified by offsets. 

===header===
The header is a list of 256 entries:
 struct SMLiquidChunk {
   uint32_t offset_instances;       // points to SMLiquidInstance[layer_count]
   uint32_t layer_count;            // 0 if the chunk has no liquids. If > 1, the offsets will point to arrays.
   uint32_t offset_attributes;      // points to mh2o_chunk_attributes, can be ommitted for all-0
 } chunks[16*16];

===attributes===
<tt>chunks[].offset_attributes</tt> points to one of
 struct mh2o_chunk_attributes {
   uint64_t fishable;               // seems to be usable as visibility information.
   uint64_t deep;                   // TC: treat as fatigue area if bit set
 };
Note that these are <tt>8*8</tt> bit masks.

===instances===
<tt>chunks[].offset_instances</tt> points to <tt>chunks[].layer_count</tt> entries of
 struct SMLiquidInstance {
   {{Template:Type/foreign_key|type=uint16_t|table=LiquidType}} liquid_type;
 #if {{Template:Sandbox/VersionRange|max_expansionlevel=3}}  
   uint16_t LVF;                    // LiquidVertexFormat, used in [[ADT/v18#instance_vertex_data]]
 #else
   {{Template:Type/foreign_key|type=uint16_t|table=LiquidObject}} liquid_object_or_lvf;        // if >= 42, look up via {{Template:DBField|table=LiquidObject|column=LiquidTypeID}} => {{Template:DBField|table=LiquidType|column=MaterialID}} => {{Template:DBField|table=LiquidMaterial|column=LVF}}, otherwise <tt>LVF</tt>
                                    // also see below for offset_vertex_data: if that's 0 and lt â  2 â lvf = 2
 #endif
   float min_height_level;          // used as height if no heightmap given {{Template:Unverified|and culling}}
   float max_height_level;          // {{Template:Unverified|1={{Template:Sandbox/VersionRange|min_expansionlevel=6}} ignores value and assumes to both be 0.0 for LVF = 2!}}
   uint8_t x_offset;                // The X offset of the liquid square (0-7)
   uint8_t y_offset;                // The Y offset of the liquid square (0-7)
   uint8_t width;                   // The width of the liquid square (1-8)
   uint8_t height;                  // The height of the liquid square (1-8)
                                    // The above four members are only used if liquid_object_or_lvf <= 41. Otherwise they are assumed 0, 0, 8, 8. (18179) 
   uint32_t offset_exists_bitmap;   // not all tiles in the instances need to be filled. always (width * height + 7) / 8 bytes.
                                    // offset can be 0 for all-exist. also see (and extend) [[Talk:ADT/v18#SMLiquidInstance]]
   uint32_t offset_vertex_data;     // actual data format defined by {{Template:DBField|table=LiquidMaterial|column=m_LVF}} via {{Template:DBField|table=LiquidType|column=m_materialID}}
                                    // if offset = 0 and liquidType â  2, then let LVF = 2, i.e. some ocean shit
 };
====LiquidObject shit====
This is very horrible writedown of <tt>Liquid::RegisterLiquidObject</tt>. 
* <tt>LO < 42 || !exists (LO)</tt>
** <tt>LM = 2</tt> â <tt>useTexCoordLiquidObject</tt>
** <tt>LM = 1</tt> â <tt>oceanLiquidObject</tt>, but if <tt>LT â  2 && LT â  14</tt> â <tt>usePlanarMapLiquidObject</tt>, but if <tt>LT == 17</tt> â <tt>usePlanarMapLiquidObjectNoSky</tt>
** <tt>LM = 0</tt> â <tt>usePlanarMapLiquidObject</tt>, but if <tt>LM = 5 && (LT = 350 || LT = 412)</tt> â <tt>usePlanarMapLiquidObjectNoSky</tt>
** {{Template:Unverified|Legion has more than <tt>0, 1, 2 LM</tt>. This is based on 18179.}} 
* <tt>LO = 42 || LT = 14</tt> â <tt>oceanLiquidObject</tt>
* otherwise <tt>LO</tt> is in DB, take that.

=====Alternate case determination=====
There is a somewhat better way to identify the case 0..3 without the need of .dbc files. 

Data in this chunk is always organized as this:

* <tt>SMLiquidChunk[]</tt>      â 16x16 (256)
* <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt>  
* byte[]               â <tt>SMLiquidData</tt>

These are the offsets, relative to the start of the chunk:

* <tt>SMLiquidChunk[]</tt>    â starts at chunk offset <tt>0</tt>
* <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt> â starts at chunk offset <tt>256 * sizeof(SMLiquidChunk)</tt>
* <tt>SMLiquidData</tt> â you need the array count of <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt>
** All <tt>SMLiquidData</tt> offsets are given in the fields <tt>SMLiquidChunk.offset_attributes</tt>, and <tt>SMLiquidInstance.offset_exists_bitmap</tt>, and <tt>SMLiquidInstance.offset_vertex_data</tt>.
** To determine the array count of <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt>, use the first <tt>SMLiquidData</tt> offset you determine when parsing. 
** The byte difference between this first <tt>SMLiquidData</tt> and the start of <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt> should be a multiple of <tt>sizeof(SMLiquidInstance)</tt>, and when divided by, give the array count of <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt>
** There is no padding, there are no holes in <tt>SMLiquidData</tt>. All data is written in the same order it is addressed by enumerating <tt>SMLiquidChunk[]</tt> and then sub-enumerating <tt>SMLiquidInstance[]</tt>
** Make a sorted list of all these offsets.

When trying to read vertex data in <tt>SMLiquidInstance</tt>, you have the current <tt>SMLiquidInstance.offset_vertex_data</tt>.
# Look for the next <tt>SMLiquidData</tt> offset in the sorted list. 
# The difference is the size of the vertex data. It should be a multiple of the vertex count.
# The vertex count of each array is known with <tt>(width + 1) * (height + 1)</tt>. 
# This gives a combined record size of all vertex data arrays. 
# Divide the total size of vertex data by the vertex count, and you get a multiplier:
#* multiplier 5 (float, char)   => <b>case 0</b>
#* multiplier 8 (float, 2x u16) => <b>case 1</b>
#* multiplier 1 (char) => <b>case 2</b>
#* multiplier 9 (float, 2x u16, char) => <b>case 3</b>

This is working for all known maps. While this is not the most elegant way, it provides an easy determination of the used vertex data structures without the need of .dbc files, or special cases that may be added in the client's code.

===instance vertex data===
Regardless of LiquidVertexFormat (LVF), the arrays will always have <tt>(width + 1) * (height + 1)</tt> entries. For layout, see LiquidVertexFormat cases below.

* no <tt>heightmap</tt> means that <tt>min/max_height_level</tt> is used for all points.
** case 2 is always at 0.0, not <tt>*_height_level</tt>!
* <tt>depthmap</tt> values are mapped to <tt>[0.0 1.0]</tt> for the shaders.

 struct uv_map_entry {
   uint16_t x;                      // divided by 8 for shaders
   uint16_t y;
 };

====Case 0, Height and Depth data====
This is the go-to layout for pre-WoD (MoP?) data. 
 struct {
   float heightmap[];
   char depthmap[];
 };

====Case 1, Height and Texture Coordinate data====
 struct {
   float heightmap[];
   uv_map_entry uvmap[];
 }

I couldn't get the UV coordinates to make sense so I ended up disabling them. -- Rour

====Case 2, Depth only data====
The liquid's height is always 0.0 regardless of the <tt>liquid_type</tt> or <tt>*_height_level</tt>!
 struct {
   char depthmap[];
 }

====Case 3, Height, Depth and Texture Coordinates====
 struct {
   float heightmap[];
   uv_map_entry uvmap[];
   char depthmap[];
 }

===example, notes===
The full heightmap that covers a whole chunk would be created from 9x9 float values, effectively creating 8x8 quadratic pieces. But since WotLK and the introduction of the MH2O chunk there is no more need to define the full heightmap if only part of a chunk is actually covered with water (such as with a thin river). Instead, MH2O_Information.x, .y, .width and .height define the size and location of a "liquid rectangle" which can be smaller than a full chunk.

An example: let's say there's a river crossing a chunk like this ('x' is the river):

 ++++++++
 ++++++++
 xxxxxx++
 ++xxxxxx
 ++++++++
 ++++++++
 ++++++++
 ++++++++

This would lead to <tt>x_offset</tt> = 0, <tt>y_offset</tt> = 2, <tt>width</tt> = 8 and <tt>height</tt> = 2. The data at <tt>vertex_data.heightmap</tt> would then list 27 float values for the height map (a 9x3 height map which results in 8x2 quads, as shown in the picture above).

The data pointed to by <tt>offset_exists_bitmap</tt> would finally define which of the quads should be rendered. Its length is just enough to cover the parts of the chunk that contain liquids. In the above example that would be 2x8 liquid tiles => 16 bits => 2 bytes. In binary (left to right) the values would be 11111100 00111111 or the two byte values 0x3F and 0xFC.

Note that it is always possible to omit <tt>offset_exists_bitmap</tt> and/or <tt>offset_vertex_data</tt> to save some bytes in the ADT file! If <tt>offset_attributes</tt> is not given, the whole liquid instance is to be rendered. If <tt>offset_vertex_data</tt> is not given, then the height map consists only of values equal to heightLevel1 (I am not 100% sure of this one, but this approach seems to work fine for me).

==  MCNK chunk ==
* split files: header in root, no header in obj and tex

*'''After the above mentioned chunks come 256 individual MCNK chunks, row by row, starting from top-left (northwest).''' The MCNK chunks have a large block of data that starts with a header, and then has sub-chunks of its own.

Each map chunk has 9x9 vertices, and in between them 8x8 additional vertices, several texture layers, normal vectors, a shadow map, etc.

'''Important: Offsets to sub-chunks are relative to the beginning of MCNK chunk, not MCNK chunk data.'''

The [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] header is 128 bytes large.

=== Terrain Holes ===

About the holes in the terrain: This is a bitmapped field, the least significant 16 bits are used row-wise in the following arrangement with a 1 bit meaning that the map chunk has a hole in that part of its area:
   0x1  0x2  0x4  0x8
   0x10  0x20  0x40  0x80
   0x100  0x200  0x400  0x800
   0x1000  0x2000  0x4000  0x8000

Since approx. 5.3, WoW uses a new 64-bit hole map if needed. If so, flag high_res_holes is set in the MCNK header and the 8 bytes at offset chunkBegin+0x14 (ofsHeight and ofsNormal) contain the hole map. Otherwise, the low resolution 16-bit hole map is used. See MapChunk::CreatePointers and/or [http://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-bots-programs/wow-memory-editing/409718-navmesh-mpq-geometry-parsing-issues.html#post2757020 this post].
Read those 8 bytes as byte array and check for holes like (Holes[row] >> col) & 1. If you interpret it as an uint64_t and shift like you did before on the 16-bit map, you have to invert the rows because of endianness.

=== MCVT sub-chunk ===

This format of terrain grid is an example of the ROAM approach (Real-time Optimally Adapting Mesh). For best practices to render and manipulate this grid refer to [https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcgt/2008/753584/ sources on ROAM]. 

<del>The inner 8 vertices are only rendered in WoW when its using the up-close LoD. Otherwise, it only renders the outer 9.</del> Nonsense? If I only change one of these it looks like: [[Media:WoWScrnShot_022409_204540.jpg]].

Ok, after a further look into it, WoW uses Squares out of 4 of the Outer(called NoLoD)-Vertices with one of the Inner(called LoD)-Vertices in the Center:
   1    2
    10
  18   19
So to render them in OpenGL you can use something like this:

   gl.glBegin(GL.GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP);
   for(int x=0;x<8;x++){
     for(int y=0;y<8;y++){
     float nL1=mcvt.getValNoLOD(x, y);
     float nL2=mcvt.getValNoLOD(x, y+1);
     float nL3=mcvt.getValNoLOD(x+1, y);
     float nL4=mcvt.getValNoLOD(x+1, y+1);
     float L=mcvt.getValLOD(x, y);
   
     gl.glVertex3f( y, x, nL1);
     gl.glVertex3f( y+1, x, nL2);
     gl.glVertex3f(y+0.5f, x+0.5f, L);
   
     gl.glVertex3f( y, x, nL1);
     gl.glVertex3f( y, x+1,nL3);
     gl.glVertex3f(y+0.5f, x+0.5f,L);
   
     gl.glVertex3f( y, x+1, nL3);
     gl.glVertex3f( y+1, x+1, nL4);
     gl.glVertex3f(y+0.5f, x+0.5f,L);
   
     gl.glVertex3f( y+1, x,nL2);
     gl.glVertex3f( y+1, x+1, nL4);
     gl.glVertex3f(y+0.5f, x+0.5f, L);
   
     }
   }    
   gl.glEnd();
Although it seems there is still a mistake :/

Old ones:

To stripify try this one: ( stripsize is now : 16*18 + 7*2 + 8*2 )

 void stripify(V *in, V *out)

 }

These points look like they might be better organized as a triangle fan instead of a strip.  This is my untested guess:
 float wowData[145];
 int off = 9;
 float x, y;
 
 for (y = 0; y < 8; ++y, off += 9)
 {
     for (x = 0; x < 8; ++x, ++off)
     {
         glBegin(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN);
             glVertex3f(x, y, wowData[off]);
             glVertex3f(x - 0.5f, y - 0.5f, wowData[off - 9]);
             glVertex3f(x + 0.5f, y - 0.5f, wowData[off - 8]);
             glVertex3f(x + 0.5f, y + 0.5f, wowData[off + 9]);
             glVertex3f(x - 0.5f, y + 0.5f, wowData[off + 8]);
             glVertex3f(x - 0.5f, y - 0.5f, wowData[off - 9]);
         glEnd();
     }
 }

The value is close enough with the intend to be always 1, but the error is as high as 7 epsilon (1 epsilon is the error caused by the fixed signed 8-bit value over all 3 coordinates). With a resolution of 1.5 degrees per coordinate unit (180Â°/127) this already causes some lighting glitches in the terrain. As I've never encountered a value of +/-127 for the X and Y coordinate, the data writer seems to use truncation instead of rounding for both coordinates, but rounding for the Z coordinate. The Z-coordinate is always positive (always pointing up/outwards). That behavior would account for the found epsilon errors. Maybe it's best to recalculate Z from X and Y. (float Z = sqrt(1 - (X / 127)Â² - (Y / 127)Â²), Z >= 0). I don't know if the client re-normalizes vectors in code or in shaders. --[[User:Nieriel|Nieriel]] Aug 2019''

*'''Texture layer definitions for this map chunk. 16 bytes per layer, up to 4 layers (thus, layer count = size / 16).''' 

Every texture layer other than the first will have an alpha map to specify blending amounts. The first layer is rendered with full opacity. To know which alphamap is used, there is an offset into the [[ADT#MCAL_sub-chunk|MCAL]] chunk. That one is relative to MCAL.

You can animate these by setting the flags. Only simple linear animations are possible. You can specify the direction in 45Â° steps and the speed.

The textureId is just the array index of the filename array in the [[ADT#MTEX_chunk|MTEX]] chunk.

For getting the right feeling when walking, you should set the effectId which links to {{Template:DBField|table=GroundEffectTexture|column=m_ID}}. It defines the little detail doodads as well as the footstep sounds and if footprints are visible. You can set the id to -1 (int16!) to have no detail doodads and footsteps at all. Also, you need to define the currently on-top layer in the MCNK structure for the correct detail doodads to show up!

Introduced in Wrath of the Lich King, terrain can now reflect a skybox. This is used for icecubes made out of ADTs to reflect something. You need to have the [[#MTXF_chunk_.28WotLK.2B.29|MTXF]] chunk in, if you want that. Look at an skybox Blizzard made to see how you should do it.

 struct SMLayer

To know how much entries there are, read until you hit the end of the chunk. Or divide it by 16 (4 + 4 + 4 + 4)

'''Notes for textureId''':

* Only in {{Template:Sandbox/PrettyVersion|expansionlevel=8|build=8.1.0.27826}}, [[#MTEX chunk|MTEX]] still exists though and is not replaced by an ID based chunk. 
* {{Template:Sandbox/VersionRange|min_expansionlevel=8|min_build=8.1.0.28294}}, [[#MTEX chunk|MTEX]] no more exists. The client referenced the texture from [[#MDID|MDID]] and [[#MHID|MHID]].


'''Explanation for flag 0x400 (use_cube_map_reflection):'''

First of all you can see the effects in this video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOE9OIG_rFM Video]  The texture that became the 0x400 flag was the following: [[Media:4b795c7c7f36b_TCB_CrystalSong_B.jpg]] . Have a look at the bright points that wander with the toon as it moves. This should imitate the stars from the sky (that you can find in the texture).

There are some important things you should be aware when using the flag 0x400:
*It doesnt matter for which layer you set the flag 0x400, it will always affect the groundlayer. 
*The common skyboxtextures need to have the same ration from width and height as the one posted above. If this isnt the case, it looks like that: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJDB6OEyxoc Video]  You see that it doesnt really fit the shape.
*All of the skyboxtextures blizzard has need to specify a special flag to be decompressed correctly. This is done using the [[#MTXF_chunk_.28WotLK.2B.29|MTXF]]-chunk. If the texture has a 1 in MTXF it will be interpreted correctly, else it will be green.

=== MCRF sub-chunk (<Cata)===
{{Template:SectionBox/VersionRange|max_expansionlevel=3|note=Now split into [[#MCRD_.28Cata.2B.29|MCRD]] and [[#MCRW_.28Cata.2B.29|MCRW]]}}

*'''A list of with MCNK.nDoodadRefs + MCNK.nMapObjRefs indices into the file's [[ADT#MDDF_chunk|MDDF]] and [[ADT#MODF_chunk|MODF]] chunks,''' saying which [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] subchunk those particular doodads and objects are drawn within. This [[ADT#MCRF_sub-chunk|MCRF]] list contains duplicates for map doodads that overlap areas. 

 uint32_t doodad_refs[header.nDoodadRefs]; // into MDDF
 uint32_t object_refs[header.nMapObjRefs]; // into MODF

The client uses those MCRF-entries to calculate collision. Only objects which are referenced in the current chunk of the toon get checked against collision (this is only for MDX, WMO seem to have different collision). If a doodad entry from MDDF or MODF gets never referenced in a chunks MCRF it wont be drawn at all, WoW doesnt take the MDDF and MODF to draw the objects.  --[[User:Cromon|Cromon]]

This chunk (doodads part only) and MCRD need to be sorted by size category if WDT's flag 8 is set. This is an optimisation to speed up culling. Note that size category â  size! The size category limits per default are <tt>1.0, 4.0, 25.0, 100.0, 100000.0</tt>. The size that is relevant is the longest side of an AABB transformed model's bounding box from the M2 header {{Template:Unverified| (it seems to be the max distance between 2 corners of the AABB)}}.


The size category is also used for culling regardless of the WDT's flag, models fade when close to the max rendering distance and disappear when hitting the max rendering distance.

 struct {
   uint1_t shadow_map[64][64];
   // or 63x63 with the last column&row&cell auto-filled as detailed in MCAL.
 } mcsh;

Thanks to Sylvain, the shadow maps work as follows: the shadows are stored per bit, not byte as 0 or 1 (off or on) so we have 8 bytes (which equates to 64 values) X 64 bytes (64 values in this case) which ends up as a square 64x64 shadowmap with either white or black. Note that the shadow values come LSB first.

=== MCAL sub-chunk ===
* split files: tex
*'''Alpha maps for additional texture layers.''' 

There are 3 kinds of alpha maps here: Which one depends on [[ADT#MCLY_sub-chunk|MCLY]] (0x200) and [[WDT#MPHD_chunk|WDT's MPHD]] (0x4 and 0x80) flags.

{| border="1"
! [[ADT#MCLY_sub-chunk|MCLY]] !! [[WDT#MPHD_chunk|WDT's MPHD]] !! mode
|-
| || || Uncompressed (2048)
|-
| || align="center"| 0x4 or 0x80 set || Uncompressed (4096)
|-
| align="center"| 0x200 set || align="center"| 0x4 or 0x80 set || Compressed: MPHD is only about bit depth! 
|}

Additionally to this, [[ADT#MCNK_chunk|MCNK]] can have (and mostly does have) the 0x8000 flag. If this flag is set and bit depth is 8 ([[WDT#MPHD_chunk|WDT's MPHD]] has either flag), then modify alpha values so that if there is shadow at the corresponding position, the alpha value is multiplied by 0.7f (178 * alpha >> 8 to be exact).

==== Uncompressed (4096) ====
 uint8_t alpha_map[64][64];

For 4096 byte chunks, just read the values straight into your alpha channel. This, again, should result in 4096 bytes for a 64px by 64px size in the final alpha map.

==== Uncompressed (2048) ====
 uint4_t alpha_map[64][64]; // note: the client uses a 4bit alpha texture, so does not do any custom normalization. Blit_Argb4444_Abgr8888 does `value & 0xF | 0x10 * value`.

Contains 2048 bytes of data, but each byte contains two values in LSB first order. This should result in a 4096 alpha map (64px by 64px).

* Read a byte.
* Split the byte into two 4-bit values. eg: b0101b a0101a
* This results in 16 possible values for each pixel; 15 is full alpha and 0 is no alpha. If you want to normalize, use Blit_Argb4444_Abgr8888 (value & 0xF | 0x10 * value).
* Record each value separately into the alpha channel in the order of a then b.

'''IMPORTANT:''' Note that depending on MCNK flag FLAG_DO_NOT_FIX_ALPHA_MAP, this is not actually a 64*64 map but rather a 63*63 map with the last row and column being equivalent to the previous one. 

  struct { uint4_t alpha_map[63]; uint4_t ignored; }[63]; 
  uint4_t ignored[64];

where 

 alpha_map[x][63] == alpha_map[x][62]
 alpha_map[63][x] == alpha_map[62][x]
 alpha_map[63][63] == alpha_map[62][62]

and all "ignored" values are ignored, while still preserving the 2048 byte footprint.

* I claim that this shall be handled by saving in fixed4444 only (i.e. always set mcnk.flags FLAG_DO_NOT_FIX_ALPHA_MAP and explicitly save the "fixed" (as in have all values) version). --[[User:Schlumpf|Schlumpf]] ([[User talk:Schlumpf|talk]]) 21:45, 24 October 2015 (UTC)

                            // maximum size is 64 times fill-64-x[64], thus 4160 bytes

* read a byte
* in the first bit of that byte (sign bit) check if it's true. When true that means we are in "fill" mode, if false, "copy" mode
* the next 7 bits of the byte determine how many times we "fill" or "copy" (count) (eg, max value 127 - actually 64, see notes)
* fill mode: repeat the byte following the one we just read *count* number of times into the alpha map
* copy mode: read *count* number of following bytes into the alpha map
* repeat until the map is complete
Notes:
* this should result in 4096 bytes in the alpha map (64 px by 64 px)
** '''This is not always the case in Blizzard ADTs!''' There are some corrupted compressed chunks that unpack to more than 4096 bytes, with no clarity where the bug happened. Noggit treats them by just stopping after 4096 bytes are unpacked. The code below does ''not'' handle this bug!
* you should not have any extra compression data left over after completion
* reads left to right, top to bottom
* values are stored line by line, compressed_alpha_map's values cannot span over several lines or the client won't be able to read the alphamap correctly
* using this format can greatly reduce the size of the ADT on disk but increase it when inside an MPQ (see below)

==== Rendering ====
'''Note''': Starting WoD, they added a new complication to rendering, namely height based factors from [[ADT/v18#MTXP]]. This led to the shader getting a bit extended to account for that. The new shader is '''able to render both''', _h added blending and "classic" blending. It can be found at [[ADT/v18#legion_terrain_shader_excerpt]]. The following paragraphs are left as further examples on how to render it, for versions before WoD.


Blizzard has changed the way how the additional textures are blended onto the ground texture in Northrend (old continents still seem to be blended the old way; they also don't use the new alpha map format). They have gone from a "one-layer-per-step" approach to blending all the 4 textures in a single step according to the following formula:

 finalColor = tex0 * (1.0 - (alpha1 + alpha2 + alpha3)) + tex1 * alpha1 + tex2 * alpha2 + tex3 * alpha3

So all the alpha values for the different layers including the ground layer add up to 1.0; the ground layer's alpha value is calculated to match this constraint.

-- [[User:Slartibartfast|Slartibartfast]] 01-11-2008

It is of course possible to devise different ways to render such terrain; one way I use and of which I know that it's working is a 2-pass-approach: first render all ground textures without blending, then use a fragment shader program to mix the 1-3 additional layer textures and render them with a glBlendFunc setting of (GL_ONE, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) on top of the ground texture already present in the framebuffer. The fragment program that mixes the textures would have to work like this short GLSL example:

 gl_FragColor =   texture2D(texture0, vec2(gl_TexCoord[0])) * texture2D(texture3, vec2(gl_TexCoord[3])).r
                + texture2D(texture1, vec2(gl_TexCoord[1])) * texture2D(texture3, vec2(gl_TexCoord[3])).g
                + texture2D(texture2, vec2(gl_TexCoord[2])) * texture2D(texture3, vec2(gl_TexCoord[3])).b;

(this example uses 4 texture units: texture0 - texture3; the first 3 of them contain the actual textures, while the fourth unit contains the alpha maps combined in one RGB texture)

Also, seems like alpha textures are upscaled using bicubic interpolation. --[[User:Deamon|Deamon]] ([[User talk:Deamon|talk]]) 21:49, 11 October 2015 (UTC)

for code which reads through all the chunks by their size, note that the size value of the MCAL chunk is often (or always?) wrong. the 3.x client reads through the chunks by size, and when it encounters the MCAL chunk it overrides the size with the 'sizeAlpha' field in the MCNK header. it does the same for the MCLQ chunk. the 1.x client, however, reads all the MCNK chunks by their offset in the header and ignores the size.

*'''Deprecated with WotLK''': I advise you to implement the MH2O one as its better if you want to write a editor for ADT files. 

The size of the chunk is in the mapchunk header. The type of liquid is given in the mapchunk flags, also in the header.

'''Note''': Presuming this chunk's data length based on <tt>IffChunk.size</tt> and/or <tt>liquidSize</tt> is unreliable; there are several cases of <tt>size != data_length</tt> and in the alpha clients there is no size indicator at all. The optimal way of parsing this chunk is to (sequentially) validate what [[#MCNK_chunk|LQ_* flags]] are set, if any, and read accordingly - this will also provide the liquid type and therefore what <tt>SLVert</tt> to use.

1.12.1 specific: Magma vertexes "s" and "t" fields is basically a UV coordinate, but you need to multiply it to a specific constant<br>
float MAGMA_SCALE_ADT = 3.0 / 256.0;<br>
float MAGMA_SCALE_WMO = 1.0 / 256.0;<br>
In SWVert and SOVert only "depth" variable is used (as well as "height" which is included in all types of vertexes), and it is an index to internal precalculated depth table.<br>

Note: height_index and height_length used to be swapped but changed it as values make more sense this way - [[User:Marlamin|Marlamin]] ([[User talk:Marlamin|talk]])

Lod is reverse here. The lower lod is - the more surface is detailed  

height_ is general height used for surface.

mapAreaLow_ is same data contained in WDL file. It's 0 for most detailed layer

----
Some thoughts: [[User:Deamon|Deamon]] ([[User talk:Deamon|talk]])

Least detailed level is 32.0 and most detailed level is 2. The values in MLLL correspond to values found in MLND.

Since MLND is quadTree, each node is twice as narrow as it's parent. So lod is reduced incremently. 

Math: in ADT there are 16 MCNK in one axis, each MCNK consists of 8 square chunks(check holesDetailed)

lod 32 = 16*8

lod 16 = 8*8 chunks

lod 8 = 4*8 chunks

lod 4 = 2*8 chunks

lod 2 = 8 chunks

Where lod 2 essentially is the same as rendering the terrain from MCNK of main ADT

Both MLLL and MLND reference MLVI. Probably, MLLL defines ranges of LOD in MLVI and MLLL is used to determine LOD level of nodes in MLND by comparasion of referenced ranges in MLVI

Note that the bounding box is for the '''transformed''' model, i.e. the bounding box from inside the file, rotated and scaled, and then the bounding box of ''that''.

Used for seeing objects map in legion from a defined distance based on the radius.
The CAaBox is defined with a max point and a min point, the points coords are servers coordinates, so you should take the object position in MODF (wmo) or MDDF (m2) and convert it to server coords from clients coords.
Radius is generally approximatively around 50 (Radius is CaaBox[3] - CaaBox[0]), the visibility object depends from the view distance param too (maybe a factor like radius * viewdistance factor)
