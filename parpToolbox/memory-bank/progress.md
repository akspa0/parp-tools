# Progress for parpToolbox

## üöÄ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH (January 29, 2025)

### Revolutionary Cross-Tile Object Discovery
**USER HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED**: PM4 objects are organized in "bands" or "layers" across multiple tiles, with massive cross-tile object subdivision.

#### Data Banding Analysis Results
- **27,087 ParentIds span multiple tiles** - Objects are literally scattered across hundreds of tiles
- **364 tiles detected** from a single PM4 file  
- **0 SurfaceKeys span tiles** - SurfaceKeys are tile-local geometry fragments
- **1 unexplored chunk type** detected with potential linking data

#### PM4 Object Architecture (CONFIRMED)
- **ParentIds** = Master cross-tile object identifiers that link fragments across multiple tiles
- **SurfaceKeys** = Tile-local surface geometry fragments within individual tiles
- **Complete Objects** = ParentId + all geometry fragments collected from ALL tiles
- **Cross-tile assembly required** - Objects cannot be reconstructed from single tiles

#### Root Cause Identified
Previous export attempts failed because they grouped by SurfaceKey (tile-local) instead of ParentId (cross-tile). We were trying to build complete objects using only fragments from individual tiles.

#### Tools Implemented
1. **Pm4DataBandingAnalyzer** - Diagnostic tool that confirmed cross-tile object patterns
2. **Pm4AnalyzeDataBandingCommand** - CLI command for banding analysis  
3. **Pm4CrossTileObjectAssembler** - Revolutionary assembler that groups by ParentId and collects fragments from all tiles

## What Works
- **Project Scaffolding & Build Health:** The solution and project structure are stable and build correctly.
- **WMO Loading:** The tool loads complex WMO files (root + groups) via `LocalFileProvider`.
- **OBJ Exporting:** WMO ‚Üí OBJ/MTL verified. PM4/PD4 exporters now reliably emit point-cloud OBJ (vertices only) to avoid viewer crashes.
- **Output Management:** `ProjectOutput` creates timestamped sub-directories under `project_output` for all generated assets.
- **CLI Parsing:** Manual argument parser covers `wmo`, `pm4`, and `pd4` commands.
- **PM4 Chunk Relationship Analysis:** Complete understanding of MPRL ‚Üî MSLK ‚Üî MSUR relationships with CSV validation.
- **PM4 Object Assembly:** 
  - ‚úÖ **WORKING APPROACH FOUND:** Spatial clustering method from poc_exporter.cs
  - ‚úÖ `Pm4SpatialClusteringAssembler`: Direct port of verified working logic
  - ‚úÖ **Verified Data Flow:** MSLK.ParentIndex = building group IDs, self-referencing = root nodes
  - ‚úÖ **Coordinate Transforms:** MSPV direct, MSVT with Y-X swap
  - ‚úÖ **CLI Command:** `pm4-export-spatial-clustering` registered and ready for testing
  - ‚ùå Pure hierarchical approaches produce fragments (WMO-inspired, ParentIndex-only)
- **Spatial Clustering Logic:** 50.0f tolerance expansion of structural bounds to capture nearby render surfaces
- **Root Cause:** PM4 hierarchical data alone insufficient; spatial clustering compensates for incomplete object boundaries
- **Region Loading:** Cross-tile vertex references resolved through unified PM4 region loading
- **Command Registration:** Spatial clustering export command fully integrated into CLI

## What's Left to Build
- **CRITICAL: Global Tile Loading System:** Implement unified PM4/PD4 loader that processes entire 64x64 tile regions as single mesh to resolve massive data loss (110,988+ missing vertex references)
- **Index Pattern Investigation:** Complete analysis of high/low pair encodings in unknown fields to discover proper 32-bit index decoding
- **Vertex Reference Mapping:** Implement cross-tile vertex index mapping and boundary handling
- **PM4 Validation:** Test global tile loading with real multi-tile regions
- **PD4 Support:** Port PM4 insights and global loading to PD4 format
- **Output Path Standardization:** Ensure all exports go to unified `project_output` location
- **Legacy Comparison:** Compare new global mesh exports with legacy Core.v2 outputs
- **Test Suite:** Integration tests for PM4/PD4 and regression tests for WMO export

## Current Status
- **WMO Export Complete.** Group naming is correct and facade planes filtered. Users can generate clean OBJs per group.
- **CRITICAL DATA LOSS DISCOVERED.** 110,988 out-of-bounds vertex accesses (~64% data loss) due to cross-tile vertex references.
- **PM4 Global Tile System Confirmed.** Individual PM4 files reference vertices from adjacent tiles, requiring unified region loading.
- **Root Cause Analysis Complete.** (0,0,0) vertices are invalid data artifacts, not mysterious anchors. High/low pair encoding likely used for 32-bit indices.
- **Enhanced Object Assembly.** SurfaceGroupKey-based grouping with MPRL transformations and improved vertex validation implemented.
- **Investigation Tools Ready.** Pm4IndexPatternAnalyzer created to systematically analyze missing data patterns and high/low pair encodings.
- **Next Priority: Global Tile Loading.** Must implement unified region loader to access missing ~63,000 vertices for complete object reconstruction.

## Recent Updates (2025-07-22)
### OBJ Exporter Consolidation Complete
- Legacy exporters (`Pm4ObjExporter`, `Pm4GroupObjExporter`, `Pm4SceneExporter`, etc.) now thin wrappers that delegate to unified `Pm4Exporter`.
- All CLI paths (`pm4-export`, `pm4` legacy aliases) funnel through unified exporter; build validated ‚úÖ.
- Deprecated point-cloud (vertices-only) mode; wrappers emit warning and export faces instead.
- Consolidation removed ~1 k LOC of duplicated code and fixes past inconsistencies (X-flip, material names).
- Next: Phase 4 ‚Äì create integration/regression tests using real multi-tile data to validate exporter parity, grouping accuracy, and MSCN remapping integrity.

### Selector-Based Grouping Insight & MSUR Selector Export (02:24)
- **New discovery:** Existing *Object_Group_* outputs are merely container shells. True object splits follow the pair of selector bytes (XX/YY) found in each MSUR entry.
- Implementing selector-key `(SurfaceGroupKey << 8) | SurfaceAttributeMask` grouping in `Pm4MsurObjectAssembler`.
- Added triangle validation to suppress invalid-index warnings; build fixes applied (init-only property error resolved).
- Pending: CLI flag `--selector-grouping` and manifest output for per-selector objects.

## Recent Updates (2025-07-21)

### CLI Simplification & JSON Report (04:55)
- Extracted `AnalyzeCommand` and `ExportCommand` handlers; `Program.cs` now delegates to them.
- Deprecated CSV outputs from `pm4-analyze`; added `--report` flag to generate a single `analysis_report.json` for cleaner results.
- Build remains green; next step is to retire redundant ad-hoc commands and expose only `pm4-analyze`, `pm4-export`, and `pm4-test`.
### PM4 Object Grouping - CRITICAL INSIGHTS DISCOVERED

**Status: MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - Objects exist, but tooling needs consolidation**

### Key Discovery: PM4 Contains Building Objects
- **3D visualization confirms discrete building objects** exist in PM4 files
- **Raw geometry export shows scattered building point clouds** - not terrain
- **Surface Groups (MSUR.SurfaceGroupKey) appear to be correct object boundaries**
- **Previous attempts (MPRL, MPRR) produced fragments/subdivisions** - not complete objects

### Cross-Tile Reference Resolution 
- **Successfully implemented and validated** (12.8x vertex increase, 502 tiles merged)
- **MSCN remapping working correctly** - resolves out-of-bounds vertex access
- **Region loading functional** - produces complete geometry datasets

### Critical Problem: Tool Fragmentation
- **8+ different PM4 exporters created** with overlapping functionality:
  - Pm4Adapter (core)
  - Pm4RegionLoader (cross-tile)
  - Pm4MprlObjectGrouper (MPRL-based)
  - Pm4HierarchicalObjectAssembler (MPRR-based)
  - Pm4OptimizedObjectExporter (performance)
  - Pm4TileBasedExporter (tile-based)
  - Pm4RawGeometryExporter (raw output)
  - Pm4SurfaceGroupExporter (surface groups)

### Immediate Need: Refactor and Consolidation
- **Feature creep has made analysis confusing and unmaintainable**
- **Need to consolidate all knowledge into core library**
- **Remove redundant/overlapping tools**
- **Establish clean foundation for future work**

### Current Focus: Refactor Plan Execution
1. **Phase 1**: Consolidate core library with all discoveries
2. **Phase 2**: Clean CLI interface (3 commands instead of 12+)
3. **Phase 3**: Build proper test suite with real data

## Recent Updates (2025-07-19)
### SurfaceGroupKey Hierarchy & Grouping Tester (22:20)
- Implemented `pm4-test-grouping` command which groups and exports geometry by `MSUR.SurfaceGroupKey`.
- Visual inspection confirms:
  - Group 19 ‚âà WMO/group-level objects.
  - Groups 20‚Äì23 are sub-objects; 24 is near per-surface granularity.
  - Values <19 appear to be larger spatial containers.
- Conclusion: `SurfaceGroupKey` represents a hierarchy, not a flat object ID.
- Action: continue exploring composite keys `(ParentIndex, SurfaceGroupKey, IndexCount)` and validate face alignment.

### Grouping still incorrect (20:53)
- MSUR.IndexCount grouping yields 15 objects but faces still mis-assigned; geometry remains scattered.
- OBJ warnings show ~480 k references to missing vertices > global vertex pool.
- Hypothesis: true object key combines multiple unknown fields (e.g., high/low bytes of `surface_key`, `reference_index`, padding).
- Action: expand UnknownFieldAnalyzer to dump **all** raw fields and auto-correlate; prototype `pm4-test-grouping` to iterate key expressions.

### MSCN Cross-Tile Remap Started
- Implemented `MscnRemapper` to append MSCN vertices and rewrite indices.
- Placeholder per-tile logic in place‚Äîneeds full region loader integration.
- Next: create `Pm4RegionLoader` to merge 64√ó64 tiles and call remapper.
- **BREAKTHROUGH: Massive Data Loss Root Cause Identified**
  - Discovered 110,988 out-of-bounds vertex accesses (~64% data loss) in PM4 exports
  - Confirmed PM4 files are part of global tile system with cross-tile vertex references
  - Available: 63,298 vertices (0-63297), Accessed: up to 126,595 ‚Üí Missing ~63,000 vertices
- **Critical Insights Gained**
  - (0,0,0) vertices are invalid data artifacts from out-of-bounds access, not mysterious anchors
  - High/low pair encoding pattern identified in unknown fields (likely 32-bit indices as two 16-bit values)
  - Sequential out-of-bounds patterns suggest adjacent tile vertex pools
- **Enhanced PM4 Object Assembly**
  - Refactored to use MSUR.SurfaceGroupKey instead of IndexCount for object grouping
  - Implemented MPRL transformation logic with position offset application
  - Added comprehensive vertex validation to prevent invalid triangles and (0,0,0) artifacts
  - Created Pm4IndexPatternAnalyzer for systematic investigation of missing data patterns
- **Tools and Infrastructure**
  - Enhanced Pm4MsurObjectAssembler with transform-aware vertex extraction
  - Added detailed logging and debugging for vertex index validation
  - Created automated chunk combination testing system (Pm4ChunkCombinationTester)
  - Implemented comprehensive CSV export for chunk cross-reference analysis

## Recent Updates (2025-07-14)
- Shared P4 chunk reader set created; identical PM4/PD4 chunks moved to `Formats/P4/Chunks/Common` with namespace `ParpToolbox.Formats.P4.Chunks.Common`.
- `Pm4Adapter` updated and `Pd4Adapter` scaffolded to use shared chunks.
- Implemented `FourCc` helper and refactored `MSPI` reader to correctly detect 16- vs 32-bit indices, preventing invalid faces.
- OBJ exporter changed to output vertices only (no faces) for initial PD4 validation; Meshlab now opens files without crashing.
- CLI enhanced with `pm4` / `pd4` commands; build passes after refactor.
- Memory bank `activeContext` tasks updated; port of legacy `Pm4BatchTool` planned for next session.

## Recent Updates (2025-07-14 16:30)
- Added bounds checks in `Pm4Adapter` when building faces to prevent invalid index ranges.
- Implemented defensive vertex index validation in `Pm4GroupObjExporter` (skip out-of-range indices, remap checks).
- CLI `--exportchunks` now functional; tool exports ~2.4k MSUR groups without crash (pending validation).

## Recent Updates (2025-07-14 22:51)
- Rewrote MSUR loader to 32-byte spec, fixing structure misalignment.
- Ran PM4 export; received **825** OBJ groups instead of expected 10-20.
- Conclusion: grouping logic still wrong; must port `MsurObjectExporter` grouping routine.
- Next step: replicate reference grouping by surface ranges matching MSLK `ReferenceIndex`, validate counts with real data.

## Known Issues
- **Agentic File Editing Failure:** My attempts to perform surgical edits on `Pm4PerObjectExporter.cs` have repeatedly failed, leading to file corruption. A more robust approach, such as a complete file overwrite, is required.
- **Tool Unreliability:** The `view_file` tool has been inconsistent, hindering my ability to get an accurate view of the file state before attempting edits.
- **`dotnet run` Argument Parsing:** When using `dotnet run`, arguments passed after `--` are not being received by the application. The immediate priority is to diagnose and fix this issue to enable proper testing and use of the tool.
