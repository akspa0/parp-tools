# PM4Rebuilder

A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing, reconstructing, and exporting World of Warcraft PM4 terrain/building data to various formats.

## Overview

PM4Rebuilder provides multiple approaches for extracting and exporting geometry from WoW PM4 files, with a focus on producing accurate building-level exports for 3D analysis and reconstruction.

## Features

### üöÄ **Bulk PM4 to OBJ Exporter** ‚≠ê *Recommended*
- **Purpose**: Export all PM4 files in a directory as building-level OBJ files
- **Approach**: Runs proven direct-export on every PM4 file
- **Output**: Organized folders with individual OBJ files per building/object
- **Status**: ‚úÖ *Working and validated - 502 files exported successfully*

### üèóÔ∏è **Direct PM4 to OBJ Exporter**
- **Purpose**: Export single PM4 scene as multiple building-level OBJ files
- **Approach**: Direct PM4 processing without database intermediary
- **Output**: Individual OBJ files per building/object
- **Status**: ‚úÖ *Working - used by bulk-export pipeline*

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database-Driven Building Exporter**
- **Purpose**: Export buildings from SQLite database using MPRR sentinel boundaries
- **Approach**: PM4 ‚Üí SQLite ‚Üí Grouped OBJ exports
- **Output**: Complete buildings based on MPRR boundary detection
- **Status**: ‚úÖ *Functional with MPRR-based grouping*

### üîç **Analysis and Diagnostic Tools**
- **Batch PM4 Analysis**: Multi-file processing and statistics
- **MSCN Linkage Analysis**: Vertex relationship mapping
- **Surface Completeness Analysis**: Data integrity validation
- **Building Aggregation Analysis**: Spatial grouping validation

## Commands

### `bulk-export` - Bulk PM4 to Multiple OBJ Files ‚≠ê *Recommended*
```bash
dotnet run -- bulk-export <pm4_directory> [output_directory]
```

**Example:**
```bash
dotnet run -- bulk-export "data/development/" "bulk_exported_buildings"
```

**Features:**
- Processes all PM4 files in a directory automatically
- Creates organized output with separate folders per tile
- Uses proven direct-export pipeline for each file
- Provides progress tracking and success/failure counts
- Handles errors gracefully and continues processing

**Output Structure:**
```
bulk_exported_buildings/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development_00_00/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_000_triangles_375.obj
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_001_triangles_376.obj
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development_00_01/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_000_triangles_423.obj
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### `direct-export` - Single PM4 to Multiple OBJ Files
```bash
dotnet run -- direct-export <pm4_file_path> <output_directory>
```

**Example:**
```bash
dotnet run -- direct-export "data/development_00_00.pm4" "exported_buildings"
```

**Use Case:** Single file processing or testing

**Current Behavior:**
- Loads PM4 scene directly (bypasses database)
- Groups geometry using MSLK linkage data and MSUR surface fragments
- Outputs multiple OBJ files (one per building/object)
- Applies coordinate system corrections (X-axis flip)
- Includes diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

**Known Issues:**
- Some cross-tile references missing (surface data from adjacent tiles)
- Objects may have incomplete geometry due to distributed PM4 data
- Grouping refinement needed for optimal building boundaries

### `export-buildings` - Database-Driven Building Export
```bash
dotnet run -- export-buildings <scene.db> [output_directory]
```

**Example:**
```bash
dotnet run -- export-buildings "scene_analysis.db" "buildings_output"
```

**Features:**
- Uses MPRR sentinel boundaries for building detection
- Exports complete buildings with proper component aggregation
- Includes building classification and metadata

### Analysis Commands

#### `analyze-batch` - Batch PM4 Analysis
```bash
dotnet run -- analyze-batch <pm4_directory> <output_directory>
```

#### `analyze-mscn` - MSCN Linkage Analysis
```bash
dotnet run -- analyze-mscn <pm4_file> <output_directory>
```

#### `validate-surfaces` - Surface Data Validation
```bash
dotnet run -- validate-surfaces <pm4_file> <output_directory>
```

## Current Development Status

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow - Direct Exporter
```
PM4 File ‚Üí Pm4Scene ‚Üí MSLK Links ‚Üí ParentId Groups ‚Üí MSUR Fragments ‚Üí Vertex Pools ‚Üí OBJ Files
```

### Key Components
- **PM4 Scene Loading**: `SceneLoaderHelper.LoadSceneAsync`
- **Building Assembly**: `AssembleBuildingsFromMslkLinkage`
- **Vertex Resolution**: `ResolveVertexFromIndex` (regular + MSCN pools)
- **OBJ Export**: Standard OBJ format with 1-based indexing

### PM4 Data Relationships
- **MSLK**: Linkage table connecting fragments to buildings
- **MSUR**: Surface groups containing geometry fragments  
- **MSCN**: Additional vertex data for complete geometry
- **MPRR**: Property records with building boundary markers

## Output Examples

### Direct Export Output Structure
```
output_directory/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_000_triangles_1097.obj  # Large building (walls, roof, floors)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_001_triangles_243.obj   # Medium structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ building_002_triangles_89.obj    # Small object/detail
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### OBJ File Format
```obj
# PM4 Building Export - Building ID 0
# Triangle Count: 1097
# Triangle Range: ParentId 12345

v -32.826920 317.932159 12.033226

f 4 5 6
# ... faces ...
```

## Dependencies

- **.NET 9**: Target framework
- **parpToolbox**: PM4 parsing and data structures
- **wow.tools.local**: Additional WoW format support
- **System.Numerics**: Vector3 operations

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd src/PM4Rebuilder

# Build project
dotnet build

# Run with commands
dotnet run -- <command> [arguments]
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Building Grouping**: MSLK ParentId grouping may create incorrect building boundaries
2. **Performance**: Large PM4 files may require extended processing time
3. **Coordinate Systems**: Some coordinate transformations may need refinement
4. **Validation**: Limited ground truth comparison for building accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Too many objects output"**
- MSLK ParentId grouping is over-aggregating
- Check diagnostic logs for cross-contamination warnings
- Consider using surface group fallback mode

**"Objects contain mixed geometry"**  
- Cross-contamination in MSLK assembly
- Review ParentId distribution in diagnostic output
- May require spatial clustering refinement

**"Coordinate system appears flipped"**
- X-axis flip correction is applied automatically
- If still incorrect, check original PM4 coordinate conventions

### Debug Logging

Set environment or enable verbose logging to see:
```
[DIAGNOSTIC] Building 0: MSLK entry references surface 5
[DIAGNOSTIC] Building 0: Surface 5 ('G40AA0A7E') has 943 faces  
[DIAGNOSTIC] Building 0 data sources:
  - Surface groups used: [5, 12, 8, 15]
  - Vertex pool usage: regular=1200, mscn=400
[CROSS-CONTAMINATION WARNING] Building 0 uses 12 surface groups - may be over-aggregating!
```

## TODO / Future Work

### üîç **Critical: Missing Geometry Investigation**
**Priority: High**

Despite successful bulk exports, exported models are incomplete and missing significant MSUR/MPRR/MSCN geometry data. The raw PM4 files contain sufficient data to support complete models, but our selection/extraction logic is not capturing it properly.

**Investigation Areas:**
- **Container/Index Selection**: Review how we traverse MSUR surface containers and index into geometry pools
- **Unknown Field Processing**: Many PM4 chunk fields marked as "Unknown" may contain critical geometry references or selection criteria
- **Cross-tile Reference Resolution**: Some geometry may be distributed across multiple PM4 tiles and requires global resolution
- **MPRR Sentinel Boundaries**: MPRR data may contain additional geometry grouping/selection logic not currently utilized
- **MSCN Linkage Data**: MSCN chunks may provide missing linkage information for complete object assembly

**Symptoms:**
- Buildings export successfully but appear incomplete/fragmented
- Triangle counts are reasonable (375-654K) but don't represent full structures
- Cross-tile surface reference warnings indicate missing data resolution
- Direct-export shows "Invalid surface reference" warnings for many surfaces

**Approach:**
1. **Comprehensive Field Analysis**: Document all Unknown fields across MSUR/MPRR/MSCN chunks with data correlation
2. **Container Traversal Audit**: Verify we're correctly processing all surface containers and geometry pools
3. **Cross-tile Data Mapping**: Implement global surface/vertex resolution system
4. **Reference Legacy Tools**: Compare extraction logic with known-working WoW model exporters
5. **Data Completeness Validation**: Quantify what percentage of raw data we're successfully extracting
